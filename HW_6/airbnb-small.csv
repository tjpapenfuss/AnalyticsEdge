62219,40622663,2015-08-01,34226723,"Michelle","I stayed in Eli's house for a month. Instantly when I met him, he was very welcoming. Booking was easy, communication was clear and instant, and description of the place was very accurate. The house is clean, which is what initially attracted me to book the place. Location is great - in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. It's safe and easy to get to and from the Subway (L) line which is literally right around the corner of the street.  Commuting was easy, only 15 minutes away from the place I needed to get to in Manhattan (14th Union Square/New York University area). Laundry is 24 hours and right across the street, grocery store next door, and plenty of options to eat around the neighborhood. I would definitely book with Eli again if it becomes an option in the future. He is kind, easy to talk to, answers any questions or concerns I had about anything (house, neighborhood, New York City, etc...). I was fortunate to have a positive experience with Air B&B as this was my first time using this service and it was great because Eli is a great host and the house was clean.",100

Kaye was extremely welcoming and encouraged us to use the shared living area, which was elegant and comfortable. She did all she could to make our stay enjoyable.

When I arrived someone was waiting for me with the key, and Michael explained stuff in the flat as well as all conveniences around to me. Yes, the laundromat on Vanderbilt really is the better one :) The location is great: Close to the 7th Ave and grand Army Plaza Subway, close to the park for all the runners and close to restaurants, cafes and all sorts of conveniences on Flatbush or Washington ave.

I looked online and found their place - they were very welcoming and made special arrangements to let me drop off my bags early before heading out to the city. 
I dare say, the things i wish were different: i wish it had been cleaner.

Derrick's studio was incredibly comfortable and clean. Located in a peaceful neighbourhood close to subway. His apartment is also beautiful as shown in the pictures. I was able to use everything, the kitchen, internet, TV and we had a key and came and went as we pleased.

Erica and I never actually met face to face due to our busy work schedules, but she was always quick to respond to any query I had with efficiency and humour.
The building is full of friendly neighbours who all say hello, an asset in such a big city. There is also a concierge and a laundry room. It's is only 5 mins walk from 145th Station and it's express trains, making my work commute incredibly easy. 
I had a great stay.",100

She's very nice, friendly, helped us with directions, taxi and everything we needed. We felt like we were at home when we were there.
The neighborhood is very safe; people were friendly and treated us like we belonged to the neighborhood. It was amazing.
There are a lot of corner stores in the neighborhood and the subway station is not that far from the apartment.

The room is huge, with three windows filling the room with natural light, which I love. However, I will say that if you are a clean freak, this is not the place for you. Other than that, the apartment is cool and well decorated, and the cat is pretty friendly. Leah keeps herself to herself, and seems like an interesting woman given the art and old movie posters around the place.",80

She welcomed us bright & early in the morning with a genuine smile, open arms, & plush fresh linens awaiting us :)

Her space was a dream!!! ... Super clean & very serene!

Location was a very nice, quiet neighborhood. I drove, so I was worried about finding a parking spot, but most days, I was able to find a spot on the same block. Shops and groceries were also within walking distance, as was the subway station, for access to Manhattan. Basic cable TV and free wifi worked great.

I had a housemate, in the form of Anna's cat. She was cute, and did not bother me except to let me know when it was time to feed her, which was an easy task. I was warned that the cat was not friendly to strangers, but we managed to coexist just fine!

I did not get to meet Anna, but she arranged for someone to meet me with the key and show me around.  Check out was also simple, and I was able to simply leave the key on the table, lock the door, and be on my way without delay.

I would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend this listing to others.",100

Justine is a very accommodating host who provided access to the full apartment (except their rooms). So it was easy to get work done at the dining table while sipping a glass of wine!

680225,224602649,2018-01-03,89712413,"Linda","We stayed in Alice's private room and it was amazing! It's a cozy townhome located a few blocks away from the subway station decorated with books and photos. The bedroom was up a short flight of stairs, and had a desk (in case you needed to get work done) as well as a bunch of lamps for good lighting. Cats roam everywhere including upstairs-which is great if you love nice kitties, but if you don't like them or are allergic to cats, this place may not be suitable for you. However, we stayed for 5 days and 4 nights and the cats were not a problem. Amenity-wise, we had everything we needed like towels and soaps, blankets and pillows, and heaters in the bedroom, and Alice even made coffee for us in the morning if we woke up late. When we checked in on a Friday night, we arrived around 1am after getting off a late flight from Newark airport. Alice stayed awake to let us in and gave us a quick tour of the house. The next morning, she knew we didn't have any breakfast foods prepared so she went out into the snow and bought us apples and pastries to eat with our morning coffee (that she also provided for us.) It was a great gesture because we were famished at that point and were meeting up with people in Manhattan which would have delayed our breakfast another 30 minutes if we were to eat there. There's no question why Alice is a super host. She's simply a delight to stay with.",100

Upon settling in, she graciously offered us a glass of wine. She made sure we were settled and felt comfortable. She really paid attention to the details, from the stack of fresh towels, to making sure we had coffee in the morning, to the croissants she had for us. Viva's apartment was sparkling clean, lots of beautiful artwork to take in and a cool 60's vibe with a sunken living room. The bedroom itself is huge with an a/c unit and lots of natural light and closet space. Viva was consistently considerate and communicative with her coming and goings and spent very little time in the apartment during our visit and always attentive to our needs. We really felt as though we were given a lot of space. The express A train makes the trip downtown/uptown bearable. I would definitely return and recommend Viva's apartment.

Sandra was fantastic to deal with and although she was away on holidays at the time, was particularly responsive and gave us a local contact in regards to check-in/out, who was also very friendly! My friend and I would both absolutely recommend this Apartment for those looking to soak in the true NYC lifestyle, and we would hurry back in an instant as soon as the opportunity arose.

What could have been a pretty miserable experience, trying to care for an 18 year old in the snow, turned into a vacation due to Michelle and Margaret's beautiful home and great energy.  Michelle even allowed us to extend our stay a few extra days.  As for the home, it was quite large on two levels, with many distinct spaces for a variety of uses.  Amazing kitchen, luxurious bathrooms and super clean. The home is even better than in the pictures. We will have to return in better weather to enjoy the large backyard.  The neighborhood was very safe, easy for walking to local cafes and shops and close to the subway.  Great experience and pretty hard to take a kid back to the dorms after that!",100

It's on a tree lined street, at the back of a brownstone and the area is so relaxed and quiet, all day and night, which is surprising given the hustle and bustle of Williamsburg these days.
Morgan and Brandon were great hosts. They have a really clean, well presented home and were very welcoming. The bathroom is wonderful, the bed is super comfortable and what the pictures don't show are the two beautiful gardens that the bedroom window looks out on to.

843943,181939910,2017-08-13,143064263,"Kayvan","I stayed at Alexander's place in Astoria over 5 nights for business/leisure. The location is quiet and very safe, the people are friendly, and the neighbourhood is scenic, vibrant and full of culture.

If you're in New York, travelling by public transit is one of the best ways to get around. Alexander's place is within walking distance to the subway and also has some great places to eat if you're on-the-go in the morning, want to sit down and enjoy some authentic Mediterranean cuisine, or need to grab a late dinner.  The commute into Manhattan from his home is also seamless.

His home is a short drive to LaGuardia Airport by taxi (which you can wave down/hail along any of the main streets in the area). If you're flying in from JFK, making the stay in Astoria is worth it if you plan on travelling into Manhattan.

Alexander was frequently checking in to make sure my stay was going well and was quick to respond to my questions with really handy tips and suggestions. Alexander's roommate, Amanda, was also very accommodating and amicable :) Thanks so much for having me and for making my first time in New York awesome!",100

It is located close to restaurants and supermarkets and at walking distance to the subway! We were seven adults and it was great to have two full bathrooms but the shower on the basement had only warm water. The basement was a little bit cold and the bed was very hard. The heating system is noisy but Tina mentioned it to us and there are lots of toys everywhere. We enjoyed very pleasant times at the dinning table and we were able to prepare our Christmas dinner in Tina's kitchen. The house is under renovation so be prepared to see some walls without painting and the railing going upstairs would need to be fixed for safety. For the seven of us and for the time that we were there Tina's house was a very good option for us as a big family but I still prefer to stay in a hotel when travelling without the group.",80

Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay and it was great to be so close to many awesome restaurants and bars. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends.",100

The apartment is tiny, but its location in the Greenpoint neighborhood made it totally worth it. Greenpoint is wonderful, a great mix of families, old folks, cute bars and restaurants, and Polish bakeries. Ultra convenient to catch the G and 7 trains.
My only real concern with the apartment was the lack to air conditioning. There is a window unit in one room, but it did not do much to battle the sweltering New York summer heat. In order to cool down at night, we kept the windows open, but due to the proximity of the Pulaski Bridge, the traffic was very noisy. Besides that the apartment was fully outfitted to meet all of our needs. Lauren has a fantastic book collection. Also, it was wonderful to have access to the roof, which boasted an incredible view of Manhattan.
We are certainly going to miss this place.",80

The nearby Riverside Church (I'm not kidding, it's at the end of the block), sets the tone for the area, but the true treasure is the Grant Memorial, which is separated from the apartment building by a park that I believe will be /gorgeous/, once there's actually green things growing in it. That was the coup de grace for me, but you will probably find the ease of travel and accommdations enough. =] As to the apartment itself, very clean, obviously well kept and cared for. My sister and I felt very comfortable, very quickly. I was so relieved to see there was a tea kettle I could use and, goodness, I could've gotten lost in the veritable library Robyn's collected! The lack of a TV forced my sister and I to, GASP, socialize!! Which I kind of appreciated, not going to lie.

The neighborhood is predominantly residential with a mix of businesses. It's not a tourist area at all so don't expect all the stereotypical NYC fanfare (you can easily get on the train and find that a few stops away).

I guess the highlight for me really was really being able to enjoy myself through watching TV and exploring the extremely convenient and safe neighborhood (It took only about 2 minutes walking to the subway). Although I did not have the chance to meet Tyler in person (I was greeted by his brother), I knew enough through our communication that he is an indubitably responsible and considerate host. During my a-week-long stay he regularly checked in with me to make sure that everything goes well, which I do appreciate. The only issue that I do need to address is that despite many of the windows facing south, the apartment in fact does not receive much sunlight. Sometimes in the morning I had to keep the light on in order to do some readings. So if this is not a part of your concern you can go for it.",80

- The Building is a top full service with an excellent team of concierge/doormen and a very nice sundeck/rooftop. It is manged by one of the top management companies in NYC, so you are really getting the full experience. 
- The apartment is on the penthouse floor. It is spacious, very nicely furnished with everything you need. Fantastic view, very airy and light. A/C, washer dryer and all household appliances worked perfectly. 
- The apartment was immaculately clean when I arrived. Jon is a true perfectionist. Everything has its place and it was no dust or anything else I could annoy myself over. I felt very comfortable in his space. It comes with high quality bedding and towels, scented candles etc. He also had removed his personal belongings and cleared out the shelf in the bathroom and cleared out closet space in the bedroom. 
- The area is great. West Chelsea. Great restaurants nearby, like momoya(fantastic sushi place, great value) coffee from grumpy, barrys bootcamp right accross the street. Traders Joe's and wholefoods a couple of blocks away. 7-10 min walk to meatpacking. You will enjoy it, its also 2 blocks from a subway stop taking you up or downtown. Very convenient location.

He welcome us with a nice bottle of wine and his sister who waited for us to open the door was very helpful and smiling. Cameron was kind enough to send an email while he was on his own trip on how to use the TV and entertainment system.  Cameron's place its exactly as advertise; in a beautiful, entertaining and safe area with easy walks to everything. The apartment is a truly New Yorker apartment, that is small but enough for 4 people and all that you need. I recommend Cameron's place and be sure to explore the neighborhood.",80

The apartment was just as advertised, clean with lots of natural light and ventilation. I did not need the AC or fan at all. However, the bathroom is very small.

The apartment was super easy to find on my own in a new area. The neighbourhood was very safe (even at 4am in the morning), with lots of shops, markets and friendly folk. The only thing was the length of walk to the subway station (about 5-6 blocks)...but I needed the exercise anyhow, lol.

Harlem is a fun neighbourhood although it can be loud until late at night/from early in the morning, and combined with the fairly ineffective curtains, if you're a light sleeper this might not be the place for you. Didn't bother us however. Biggest issue with the apartment was that the shower takes an astonishingly long time to heat up, but on the whole I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying here, as it's just as beautiful as it looks, and this is only a minor concern.",80

The apartment is in the Upper West side, 10 minutes to Central Park, and 2 minutes from the subway station to the Red line (8 stops to Times Square, 4 with the Express line) which drives you directly to Midtown and Downtown. It's also cool just walk from the apartment to times square to enjoy the city, it take around 30 minutes walking. So it is really well located.

The studio is very nice, with a little terrace, and includes everything you need to enjoy your stay. It is quite, clean and comfortable and has a nice neighborhood.

Our one regret was the discomfort of the full sized bed, which creaked loudly and sunk in the middle despite the modest size of the occupants (we are both runners and were eager for a good night's sleep).

The windows look onto a small closed courtyard so it is definitely calm at night. Michael was constantly accessible by email, and quickly responded to my messages. The place is only half a block from subway lines E and 7, and about 15 minutes from Times Square, plus we got to see the Manhattan skyline from the Gantry Plaza State Park, which was unbelievable at night!

The apartment is well located and extremely close to the subway, which was very convenient to go anywhere, especially to downtown Manhattan. The area is surrounded by groceries, fast-food restaurants, shops... It seemed a safe area to me.
My room was fine, clean, and in accordance with expectations. However, I found the apartment quite messy... The kitchen and living room could have been tidier and cleaner. But believe me, it was okay, I was not disgusted by anything. Also, I had to buy some base products, such as paper towels... I think there should have been some.
The bathroom I used was not bad, with a large shower cabin. But again, it could have been cleaner. Moreover, the apartment is dark. You have to turn on the lights at almost any time of the day, or you don't see anything.

Amino's place is well taken care of and clean. The neighborhood isn't extremely touristy, but we were able to find some yummy coffee shops and cafes within a 15-20 min walk (we really loved a place called the PLG Cafe and went there like 3 different times). And you have the 2 and 5 subway lines only 2 blocks away. 

The one thing I would caution future summer travelers of is the heat. There is a window unit in the living room which works great and gets the room to a comfortable temperature pretty quickly. However, no A/C in the bedroom and the outside temps were high 80s (and even got into the 90s) when we were there. Luckily Amino has a wonderful extreme fan in the bedroom which definitely kept the air moving. Without the fan, it would be pretty uncomfortable to sleep in.

There are also several subway stations just a few blocks away. The J-train dropped me off from JFK one block from the apartment. I had a meeting near Wall Street and the 6-train took less than 10 minutes. The 6 in the opposite direction too me to central park in 20 minutes. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The apartment is shared but the roommate wasn't there at all. The kitchen was stocked. 

The Apartment is in a prewar building so you'll have to walk up 4 flights of stairs, which wasn't bad at all. 
 I will definitely stay here again on future visits. I have stayed in other areas of the city but this is by far the coolest and most convenient area; there are tons of shops, restaurants, film theaters, art galleries, groceries, bakeries, etc etc

The place was clean, cozy and the room was good size with a comfortable bed.

The large TV is nice to have, too.  East Village is also a good area for a stay, you can walk in all directions or will find subway stations within 3-4 blocks (the subway is fast!). 
For going out I recommend ""Veselka"", Ukrainian Restaurant, on 2nd Av/9th Str. ""Trader Joe's"", 142 E 14th Str, might be the best option if you want to fill up the frig.

Sha was always friendly and courteous, and frequently asked me whether I was comfortable and happy with my stay.  The few requests that I made were quickly addressed (e.g. more hangers)

The apartment is huge compared to Manhattan apartments.

His family has a child and there were plenty of toys for our children to play with.  The view was of the main street below and not really much to look at, although it's NYC and you're not there to sit in the apartment and stare out at the view!  The elevator to the apartment was perfect, and MUCH needed.  Every time we've stayed in NYC we've made the mistake of not having an elevator, so this was definitely a huge plus.  Honestly, this was our favorite place we've stayed in NYC so far, although it's a little distant from all the cool stuff to do.  If you have kids, this place can be kind of far.  If it's just you or a couple, then it'd be perfect!  It's about 2 blocks from a subway station and you can pretty much get anywhere in the city within 30 to 45 minutes.

I didn't see Auminea as she was in in Australia but she was very nice and helpful over email, as was her roomate. He helped me with my bag upstairs, he lent me clean sheets when I arrived as the ones on the bed weren't clean, and he answered any questions about the area I had super fast. 
Fantastic location, literally 2 mins walk to the L, Bedford Ave is one stop from Manhattan. 
The room and apartment were not that clean, a lot of dust and hair.. more than I would find acceptable, others may not.
The person in the apartment above sounds like a herd of elephants and seems to walk across her flat all night. There was a rave outside the window which started at midnight and was still going when I left for the work the next morning which meant zero sleep. There is also a high school opposite the window, very noisy if you want to sleep in on a week day. Not a great apartment for sleeping. 
The room doesn't look quite like the photo as there are packing boxes lining the wall, plus there is no way to hold the curtains open so it was hard to let natural light in.
Excellent location for Bedford ave, if noise and super clean don't bother you it's a great room.

6150778,32707786,2015-05-20,21643223,"Jezzika","HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!!!! I booked a 5-day stay at Adam's place about 2 weeks in advance, as I found this place to be one of the best deals in terms of location, price, and quality. 
Adam left two fresh towels folded on a neatly made bed, and his roommate was there to give me a set of keys.
The place is BEAUTIFUL without feeling luxury so you get the homey vibe, and huge for a NY apartment!! 
The only warning is that it is located on the 4th floor, so you will have to climb 3 flights of stairs each time you come in but that is in no way a deterrence. The location is prime for any Williamsburg/Brooklyn exploring, a quick 3-5 minute walk to the train stops to get into Manhattan, and there are tons of bars and food places nearby so it's always bustling. 
I saw Adam's roommate Todd (who was also there at the time) one time in the 5 days I was there. But Todd is a super chill guy who is easygoing anyways, so it wouldn't have been a bad situation if we were home at the same time. 
The bedroom has a great view of the neighborhood and the exposed brick gives such a great feel to the place. The bathroom is extremely nice and clean, and nothing is cluttered so it was great for my friend and I who stayed there.

The bed is comfy and the living room is a great place to unwind at the end of the night and watch TV.

Next time I'm back in NYC, I'm definitely looking to see if this spot is available!",100
6152478,42873716,2015-08-16,1193173,"Brent/Natalie","Overall this room has a lot of potential, but the negatives outweighed the positives during my stay.
Upsides:
1. Very cute, nicely-furnished apartment.
2. Nana was very helpful with check-in/arrival, friendly, answered texts promptly and was very flexible with check-out, which I greatly appreciated.
3. Pavlov, the dog is super sweet.
4. The room itself was pretty spacious for NYC.
Downsides:
1.  Apartment is very small and both bedroom doors are large, glass French doors that face each other and open onto the very small main living areaa (which includes kitchen and dining table), so absolutely NO privacy unless you are in the bathroom.  Some sort of window coverings on both bedroom doors are badly needed.  From most places in my bedroom I could see directly into most places in the host's bedroom (and vice versa of course)! 
2. The bed/bedding situation was far from ideal.  The bed is a twin daybed, so it has a head and footboard and may be cramped for anyone over about 5'5"".  The bed was made when I got there but was very uncomfortable - turns out I slept the first night on a boxspring, not a mattress, with no mattress pad and only a thin sheet to cover it.  The next day I noticed that the mattress was actually UNDER the bed on the floor, and I had to pull it out and put it on top by myself and remake the bed - again no mattress pad (I asked), so only covered with a thin sheet.  There was a ""feather bed"" to put on top of the mattress, but it also had no cover.
3. Beware the bathroom door lock - I got locked inside one night while I was showering and it took me 30 mins to ""jimmy"" the door open with my nail scissors and my tweezers.  I didn't lock it again after that!
4.  The rug in the bedroom needed a good cleaning/vacuum.

The bedroom itself had great light and I slept most nights with the windows open, which was refreshing and breezy. The apartment takes two floors of a typical Brooklyn brownstone that I loved - and walking to the subway / running errands / going out took the shape of an amazing stroll of some of the most beautiful architecture Brooklyn has to offer. I met Lanneau, Cliff's roommate, a couple of days into my stay - an amazingly creative, chill, warm, welcoming, open, smart, funny man who recommended a wine store and hung out with my friends while we all listened to music. We even found out that through the magical network that is Brooklyn, his friend is the twin brother of my friend's neighbor (if that makes sense). I spent too much time out to really make the best out of their great backyard, but maybe on another visit ;) the cats, Food and Menu, come and go as they please and are very low maintenance.

6316666,36781901,2015-07-01,17135290,"Casey","The place is in a beautiful building, nice stone architecture. It's a walkup, up three flights, so keep that in mind.

The neighborhood is beautiful. It's quite gentrified, but there are still some cheaper food joints. It's not totally soulless. Park Slope is also about as safe as you can get. It feels more that way than much of Manhattan.

The place is in the middle of the neighborhood, so it's a 7 minute or so walk from any of the three train stations, which is a bit far.  But those three stations offer five unique lines, so you can get to many places without transfers.  Certainly to the major stations in Manhattan. 

The roommates are extremely nice and welcoming. We chatted a few times and they do their best to make the experience a pleasant one. They said I could use their dishes, eat their food, watch Netflix on their PS4, and all that. Very nice, and not really expected from strangers!

The room is small but just fine. The main problem was that it didn't have air conditioning. There's no AC in the apartment as a whole, and nor is there in the room. There's a fan, but that doesn't go very far when it's over 80 and the air source (an alley) doesn't get wind and tends to stay warm. AC would make this an excellent listing.",60

Great communication.....
Great house notes.....
Great house - just as pictured, very clean, very well kitted out- Nespresso and Sonos..what more could a fella want...
 
To 'do' both Brooklyn and Manhattan it's a great location. Stylish local street 50 m from Carroll Gardens Subway so very easy to get to Williamsburg, Brooklyn Bridge etc and into lower and upper Manhattan  for all the iconic sight seeing that you could want. Very safe area and actually if you decided to only eat locally then in 8 days you would never need to go back to somewhere twice ( within 3-5 mins are Italian ( of course as almost Little Italy) Greek/ Vietnamese / Thai / American /seafood/pizza, more pizza/ Fine dining / wine shops/ supermarkets ( incl Whole Foods, which if you have never been...prepare yourself for extraordinary displays/ ranges of grocery foods 

Anything negative? Yes....I cant live there.....

Would strongly recommend this to any friends thinking of doing NYC

I rented a small room in Aristotle's three bedroom apartment to help during my transition to the city while I found a flat for myself. Aristotle's apartment is very well located in close proximity to the J M and Z lines. The G line is just a 10-15 minute walk away. It takes about 15-20 minutes by train to get to Manhattan, which is very nice! The room was cozy and had everything I needed for my two week stay. The living room is nicely decorated. Aristotle often has people around, so it's a very lively apartment! I personally thought it was a nice touch, but if you mind some noise, then this is not your place.

The night before our arrival, she asked that we come at 2:30pm.  We arranged to drop off our luggage and return later since we were coming straight from the train, but this was inconvenient.  When we met, Maurine was very friendly.  Unfortunately, after she left, we realized that the shower was not very clean and not draining correctly.  There was also a lot of mildew.  My husband tried to take a shower but the water would not drain.  The neighbor downstairs actually had a leak into her apartment. We moved out after 1 night and found a last minute hotel room.  We agreed to pay for one night + cleaning fee. Maurine was understanding, however when it came to refunding us for our stay - we were only offered 68% of our fee back when we only stayed 1 of our scheduled 6 nights.  This is very disappointing given that the hotel room was much more expensive.  I would not stay at Maurine's again.  If you do, bring shower shoes.",40

Jen left the key to the doorman of the building so I was able to pick it up at the time I wanted, quite andy.

However, I was very surprised when I realised that the flat was dirty. It looked like Jen was moving with boxes and dust all around. Airbnb should be a win-win situation and in that particular case, that wasn't. I am perfectly conscious that this is not a hotel but what i do know is that cleanliness is basic. I don't get paid for having to clean myself the appartment.

We used key cafe to pick up the keys which was very easy with no issues.",80

The pictures perfectly capture the studio - it's cozy, extremely clean, and has everything you need. The location is great and it's close to multiple subway stations. Though the studio is on the first floor of the complex, the street it's on is relatively quiet and the fan near the bed acts as a pretty good sound machine.  Matt responded quickly to my e-mails and texts, and he made checking in/out super easy.  His fiance prepared detailed instructions for the apartment which helped me settle in quickly.

I instantly felt at home in Megan's place. I like to read and to browse through her collection was- along with the paintings and artifacts- a real treat. I'd definitely like to know the stories behind the art she owns. There was a heatwave the week I was there and the air conditioning made the whole time there even more comfortable. Other than that, Meagn's place is as it is pictured and huge!! For me, it was good to be able to spread and not have tip toe around roommates at home in Chciago.

The bathroom was simply disgusting. The toilet wasn't working at all. I had to fix it twice BY MYSELF because Rob's roommates apparently didn't care. Once, someone peed into the toilet but didn't bother with flushing it. So I come to the bathroom and there was a toilet full of urine. I know that's not Rob's mistake, but he's the one who's renting an apartment and if he can't assure that his roommates are neat, he shouldn't rent the apartment at all.",20

She came by a couple of times to pick up things she needed from the apartment while I was staying there, but she always gave me a heads-up first.

I was desperately looking for a nice and cheap place to stay during my vacation to New York. I was so happy when I found his listing. It was like a miracle. Great apartment in Brooklyn. It was very clean and neat. I had the whole place to myself for the first week! (Sister-in law came back from her vacation.) I got to stay in his big room. Gil made me feel right at home. He cleared his desk, drawers and closet for me to put my things. He provided me with everything I needed and even welcomed me to any food he had lying around. Communication with him was a little slow since he was on vacation but I still received a response within a day or two. The neighborhood was okay. I never felt threatened in any way. This place is better than any hotel you can find for the price. My only complaint is that my visit was during winter so the heater had trouble keeping his room at a nice warm temperature. If you're lucky enough to be able to book Gil's apartment do it! I would definitely stay here again if it is available during my next visit to New York. Thanks buddy!",100

We really enjoyed the apartment because it was clean, uniquely decorated, comfortable, and conveniently located near several bars, coffee shops, shopping, music venues, and the Hudson River. 

The bathrooms were clean and the shower had great water pressure. There was a kitchen for cooking, which we used to store snacks in. The beds were comfortable. The living room is open with high ceilings and lots of light. 

The hosts were available by phone and text message for questions. We thought it might be nice to watch a sunset on the roof deck of the apartment building, however after walking up to the top floor we found the door to get onto the roof deck was alarmed. I called Pippa to question whether the roof deck was open and if it was okay to go out on it. She informed us it was actually closed. It was nice that she was so responsive. We also had questions about the wifi which were solved right away with Pippa and Asa's swift responses.

I have been to New York City several times and usually plan an annual trip. We usually book a hotel, but it is often difficult to find hotels with three separate beds so we decided to try airbnb this year for the first time. This was a great first experience. 

I would book this apartment again because our stay was a pleasant one! Thank you for being great hosts! 

If you book this location, some of my favorite coffee shops were Black Cat LES and Cafe Vita. Black Cat LES had an interesting speakeasy style decor and is only a block away from the apartment. They make their own oatmeal which was filling and delicious. For an Italian coffee experience, I would recommend Cafe Vita, where you stand to drink your coffee. If you love donuts, you might want to check this place out because they were huge! I imagine you wouldn't be hungry for lunch after one of them!

This was the worst experience I have ever had traveling.  I was alone with my two preteen daughters.  So I was nervous.  There wasn't a chain on the door.  Just one lock on the door and the door to the lobby as well as the garbage door were always propped open all day.  So we never felt safe.  When we opened the door we couldn't believe how dirty it was.  There was even mold hanging down off the fan.  Sam reported to us that it had just been cleaned.  When a cleaning lady finally did arrive three days into our stay she reported there was no way anyone cleaned that apartment.  The kitchen was not stocked as reported.  The TV did not work as described.  The bedding and towels were not new or even gently used as described.  The windows look out into brick walls on both sides so it is dark.  It was quiet only because of the constant hum of the air conditioners which were nice.  When they were off though you could hear the neighbors conversations.  The Internet was strong and worked well.  The beds were comfortable once we had replaced the bedding.  The bathroom was nice once we bought new towels and had scoured it.  The chair in the living room was torn and dirty.  I would encourage Sam to do some work on his place before he rents this space again.",20

First, the apartment is small but enough to fit 2 or 3 people. Small kitchenette, one sofa at the living room, and one air mattress that we could never set up to work right. No space to hang anything, and actually, looked like they didn't expect to receive anybody even though we confirmed booking since first week of the month. The place looked messy, with stuff lying around everywhere, but the worst part is, beneath the messines, it was dirty. 
Even though i priorly asked for a set of clean sheets and clean towels, i got them, but definetely not clean. Had to bought new towels, because the ones we got smelled funny.
Every space of the house was at best dusty, at worst filled with women hair. By the second day we had to sweep and mop the entire place to feel a little comfortable, but really didn't help. We left by the 4th day. I know the price wasn't high, but to pay 25US for the cleanliness was a bad joke.

On the bright side location is awesome. Harlem is a really nice place to stay. You will find a store or bodega in every corner, the 16th st subway is a couple blocks away, and around on Frederick douglas Av. you can find a bunch of restaurants, bars, cafes and some stores, great place to hang around at night. Central park is 10 min. walking distance.
You see a lot of locals hanging around on the streets all day and night, but nobody messes with you, i never felt unsafe or threatened. If you want to meet the real harlem, walk up north some 5 minutes to 125th avenue where you can find cinemas, stores and chain restaurants, and mostly the local harlem flavor.

The room was pleasant and cosy and Lea really made it nice for us, even giving some tips about the neighborhood. It has A/C, too.
The neighborhood isn't the ""nicest"" one, I guess, if ""nice"" means wealthy, but it felt super safe, and a flatmate told me it's around the corner from where Jay-Z grew up, so that's cool. It's literally thirty seconds to the G subway.

Caitlyn was away on spring break during my stay, so unfortunately we didn't get to meet but her room mates (and kitty!) were extremely helpful and the apartment felt very cozy. When we arrived, there was a really sweet letter on the desk with lots of advice and tips, along with the key I kept on hand during the week to let myself in and out of the apartment. If I had to make a complaint to give advice to other folks looking at this listing, (I don't want to! I loved my time there so much!) the wifi was pretty lousy so maybe don't stay here if internet is a must. My iPhone didn't seem to really pick it up most of the time and we weren't able to stream any video without pretty extreme difficulty and lots of buffering so we gave up on trying to connect to it altogether. Also some friends of a roommate came over during our stay, which I totally didn't mind, but one was sorta bothering us in our room and then got pretty sick.  I wouldn't recommend staying here if you're an adult or are bothered by drunk/high folks, but it was the perfect place for two young people visiting the city to check out colleges. The J train was a less than 10 minute walk away from the apartment, so getting in and out of Manhattan every day with our 7 day metro card was a breeze! Didn't take a single cab the whole time we stayed. Please stay with Caitlin if you can, it's a great deal and a lovely spot!",100

PROs: Three blocks from the subway and bus stop and shops are close by.
CONs: 
Rough Neighbourhood. People lingering around the entrance of the building, wasn't very encouraging to go out at nights. Once we were in for the evening we never went outside. 
Surrounding is dirty. The building, staircase etc is very dirty. Not a property ready to accommodate guests. The inside of the apartment needs a lot of fixes before ready for renting as well. 
The bed is noisy and uncomfortable. The couch is dirty, I suggest proper cleaning or a couch cover, we just put towels over it. We could not sleep the first night due to the noisy smoke detector so we took the battery out. The kitchen was equipped with the necessary but we ate out at all times. 
The couple tried to make contact but we were either out or had an international number. There is NO WIFI , so starbucks, BK and McDonalds were our best friend.
The area was just not the best for our first trip to New York and the walkways and walls are very dirty. Could use some maintenance.",40

From travel advice to get to his place from the airport, to advice on food in the vicinity and being available via text at almost any time of the day, Grayson is a host who anticipates the guest's every move.

There was no question left unanswered, even before our arrival, and his apartment was exactly what made it a true New York experience. With a subway a block away, downtown was a quick ride away and everything worth seeing became accessible at any time we wished.

Juliana was really nice (very easy going, had clean blankets and towel available and was very communicative throughout my stay!) and her apartment is one of a kind, probably one of the nicest ones that I have seen in NYC. The room does have a balcony which is really nice and overlooks Bedford (I heard there is a terrace too but I forgot to check it out). The bed is super comfy, and the kitchen is to die for. Then the bathroom (or shall I say bathrooms, there are 2) and shower is the nicest I have ever seen (seriously). Oh and there is a washer and dryer in the apt that I could use! There was also a really nice dog that kept me good company! The only downfall I would say, for those who are sensitive to light, is that the door has a blurry glass window in front of the living room so it won't be completely dark (or quiet) if there are people hanging out in the living room. Then, Crown Heights is an awesome up and coming neighborhood with nice cafes around, several supermarkets closeby, subway station a few minutes away, and Eastern Parkway which is a really nice street to walk (~18 min) to prospect park and Grand Army Plaza Library. I would totally recommend it!!",100

First of all Jarred is a really nice guy and I enjoyed all my interactions with him.  As Jarred stated, the ceiling in the main area is 6 feet. I'm 5'10 and 3/4 inches and didn't have any issues there, although I had to duck when entering through the main entrance and entering the bathroom, and going to an area where there was a fridge available. Getting into the basement takes some getting used to - you descend descend down some steep stairs and go through an ante chamber once you open the metal door.  The bed/futon creaks a bit when you move. I didn't sit at the desk because I though I would forget about the pipes and stand up, hitting my head. The neighborhood has a latino flair and is vibrant.

The apartment was very clean and well-decorated, and the room and bed were both as large and comfortable as described!  The room also definitely has great transit access.  Caitlin was very accommodating of our preferred check-in and check-out times, and in fact we never actually met - instead, Caitlin's friendly mother met us at the apartment to check us in, and she helpfully provided us with advice about the area and how to get around.  Given how responsive Caitlin was in all of our other interactions, I'm sure she would have been happy to meet and chat if we had asked, but we mostly kept to ourselves and often felt as though we had the apartment to ourselves, which we were quite happy about.  We also fell in love with her fun and friendly cat.  All in all, a very positive experience that I would definitely recommend.  An important thing to keep in mind for future guests would be the means by which the room is separated from the rest of the apartment - the ""thick curtain wall"" described in the listing.  While certainly effective at partitioning the room, it's obviously not quite equivalent to a real wall in terms of privacy, which is worth bearing in mind if that's something you absolutely need.",100

He was always very communicative and responded very quickly.  The room is very small, just as advertised and the bed was comfy.

I had asked one of Dominic'a roommates to help me lock the door once but he was very rude and completely ignored me.  Dominic said that'd he would talk to him about that to ensure that it wouldn't happen again.

Suraj was very helpful from the beginning and handled everything in a professional and friendly manner. Check-in and check-out were simple.

It was near the M and the J train and had a market across the street and coffee shops within walking distance. The neighborhood was definitely not  gentrified, which I appreciated, and I felt very safe walking even at night. The apartment is incredibly bright. This was great for me because I love getting up early, but if you like to sleep in bring some eye covers! The bed was comfy, and despite the heat (ridiculous heat wave for the beginning of September), the apartment stayed very cool. Her cats were SO SWEET. The black one was particularly feisty and talkative and slept with us in the bed, which I adored. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that we couldn't use her TV. She left a computer but we couldn't access any of our Netflix on the tv. Hopefully she'll get that figured out for the next guest. Adrianna was very available, even though she was in Berlin. She answered all my questions and was extremely helpful. Getting and returning the key was a breeze, too. Thank you for the best New York trip I've made thus far!

I ended reaching the apartment at the same time as Paul so he was able to greet me in person. 

The apartment and room were as nice as advertised. It was a pretty spacious room/apartment for NYC. Given the price point I can't really complain. I wish there was a lamp in the room and the pillow was very stiff.",100

The contact we had with him was when we met and he gave us the key. The best things about this place is the location-it was extraordinary for us. It was a 5-10 min walk to the L (grey) line-Morgan station-easy access to everything and about 20 minutes to Manhattan and Willimsburg. It is also within walking distance to a wonderful Mexican/Latino neighbourhood along Myrtle Av/Knickerbocker Av. Great Mexican food and natural juices for cheap. It felt safe around the neighborhood at night. There was free parking on the street.  The pictures are accurate. The apt was very clean. The room is small but was adequate for our needs. The bed was comfortable. Ryan provided towels. The room is on the main floor of a building. It was a bit noisy at night/mornings when other tenants of the building were coming/going as the entrance door to the building slams pretty hard, and you can hear walking/talking in halls . The building attached was being renovated so it was quite noisy a few mornings. Ryan has 2 roommates whom were hardly around.  Overall for us it was a great first trip to New York City.",60

I arrived in the evening, and she had put a nice sandwich in the fridge for me. Being new in the city, it was nice to know someone else. She actually organised various meals and drinks out with friends and myself also which was really great. Even though we both had similar weekly schedules, it was not a problem sharing the facilities. I got to meet Vishnu the day before I left and he is a great guy also. Both are easy to talk to and will go out of their way to make your stay easy, comfortable, and enjoyable. 

The listing has a whole bunch of details in it which are accurate. The photographs represent the place accurately as well. I stayed in the main bedroom which I imagine is pretty large for NYC. Added to the various subway options and proximity to many shops and food options close by, Boerum Hill is a cool neighbourhood with a laid back feel. The street is quiet, with people who would say good morning. Natural light comes into the bedrooms as well as the house through a central skylight, and the kitchen looks back out over a green garden area. At the front, they have a stoop for chilling out. 

Out in the city, in and out on work days, or just hanging out in Brooklyn, it was a nice place to come back to and there were never complications.",100

His room looks exactly like the pictures. It is quiet, airy, spacious, has a lot of sunlight. I had really good sleep there. Apartment is quite big and is located on the third floor. There are four people living there, I didn't see them a lot as they were either not there or kept to themselves, but all seemed friendly and respectful.

The apartment is close to a few great coffee shops and is a short walk from several convenient train stations that lead directly into Manhattan (generally around a thirty minute trip). Bushwick itself is also fun to explore. I would definitely recommend staying here, it was a great experience!",100

The apartment building is an old brownstone in a neighborhood of other unassuming brownstone homes. And though the front of the house and the entryway are nothing special, Maggie's actual apartment is beautiful and very tastefully decorated. She has wonderful style! The apartment is clean and comfortable, and the bedroom is private. Maggie stayed in her own bedroom on the end of the hallway. I felt as though she was accessible if needed, but she gave us our privacy during our weekend stay. Maggie is very kind and a welcoming face to meet in Brooklyn - would be happy to stay here again!

The location was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood was safe-enough. There was plenty of on-street parking. And we really enjoyed running to Prospect Park on Saturday morning for the farmer's market (about 2 miles). Highly recommend!",100

The apartment and location are fantastic, the area is full of bars and restaurants but never too loud. The people who live in the apartment are great guys and Walter is a great host who ensured things were always fixed.

8807842,53421663,2015-11-08,4077301,"Philip","A few days before arriving, Rebecca asked if would mind staying in her other loft space down the street from where this listing was. No problem, she sent pictures and the place looked clean and fine. So this review is about her other place on Seigel St in Brooklyn. 

The good: Rebecca is a friendly person and good at communicating with her guests. Booking, coordination and checking in and out went fine. We stayed in Rebecca's room in a shared loft space with 2-3 other girls. Her room was tidy and looked fine. 

The bad: Her place is one of those Brooklyn loft spaces which have been cheaply converted into shareable spaces. The bedrooms are basically made up of super thin dry wall construction with no windows (except small windows in the top). There is no sound isolation so you can hear everything. We woke up several times in the night when her room mates would come home drunk and re-heat food in the microwave. Even though they tried to stay quiet. You just hear everything. The rooms don't have any windows, except a few bizarre small windows in the roof into the living room and the other rooms. This mean, if any of the roommates turn on a light in their own room it will light up your room and keep you awake. 

The ugly: The place is a complete mess! There is trash everywhere and I have no idea when they cleaned the last time. There is a trashed ikea bed in the living room and beer bottles, plastic bags and trash piled up everywhere. 

I didn't rent the living room so in my opinion they can do what they want in their shared space. But you would have thought they would at least want to take out the trash or something when having AirBnb guests over. We were really disappointed by the state of the bathroom since it was a room we actually had to use; it was disgusting. We called Rebecca out in this when we checked in and she did a brief clean up the day afterwards. 

I am sorry for this negative review but I believe it is important to be honest towards the host and future guests. I would not recommend renting this place as it is not ideal for hosting guests and the people living there do not seem to make an effort to keep the place tidy and welcome for guests. Maybe you would like it if you are in the beginning of your 20s, looking for partying in New York and don't care about where you crash at night.",20

On arriving we were able to meet Eric and his friends, they were all so welcoming to us both; interested and polite, even after we'd arrived later than expected.

We had no problems, whatsoever, with the apartment/room or location, everything was incredibly easy to commute back and forth; Metro stop, literally, steps from the front door. The local area is nice and I never felt it to be unsafe, even when I was wondering around after midnight to find food I ended up having a nice chat with people.

Eric was accessible throughout our time in NYC, even making contact to enquire how our days were going & open to any queries/advice, and his flatmate was always polite and cool whenever we saw one another.

Our first three months was jumping from hotel to hotel.  Our 4th and 5th month was at an extended hotel at W94th. That was a great experience.  Somehow, we got lucky on our 6th month when we found Sarah's apartment. Had I known that apartment accommodation is this pleasant, I should have looked for apartment from day 1.  Sarah's place was perfect. 

Transaction with Sarah was easy. She is very professional and always just a phone call away for any questions.  She  somehow made me feel like a friend too.  The easy, smooth transaction with her  made everything really pleasant. 

Her apartment is in the Columbia University housing.  It is spacious, functionally decorated which to me was perfect, in a building with nice and very helpful personnel.  Location wise, it was perfect for a quick walk or jug by the Hudson River and  close to buses particularly for LGA.  It was within an easy access to train 1 which made commute to anywhere easy.

The experience pretty much matched the price. A heating problem caused the room to be very hot, even with the window open. Loud noises from the street plus the open window made it hard to sleep. The door to the apartment was very difficult to use; we were able to make it work, but it took some practice. If you're a single female, I'd advise you to be careful in the neighborhood; it isn't a safe part of Bushwick.

On the more positive side, the room was clean and thoughtful accommodations were provided.

It was a fair price, but I'd pay a little extra for a more relaxing experience next time.",60

A word of warning (out of the scope of responsibility of the apartment's owner): the phone networks in all the area work pretty bad, especially ATT and T-Global.  If your task depends on receiving calls at your phone you might have a problem.  If you can connect through  WiFi/internet then it's fine.

However, we had many difficulties with this subway line, because at night it changes its schedules and it presents delays. There were days we have to get five different subways and spend three hours to get at the apartment. The apartment is on the top floor (4th floor) and the building has no elevator, so if you take a lot of bags, it will be difficult to get around. About the cleanness the score is zero. When we've arrived at the apartment there were two owner guests in another room and they left a very dirty and foul-smelling environment. This smell settled into our room and it was not gone. The bathroom was very dirty and the room we stayed in had signs of dirty that I believe have never been cleaned. We made the claim via airbnb to the owner, with the expectation that at least he would send someone to clean the apartment, but it did not answer our complaint.",40

The subway runs on an elevated track at the level of Nima's third-story windows less than 100 yards away. It is neither quiet nor especially loud. We happened to find the passing train soothing as well as nice piece of authentic New York scenery. Nima was an excellent, generous host. We did not meet, but he was a prompt, clear, thorough communicator. His apartment was very clean and tidy.

Perfect location, 10 mins to 1st Ave on the L. The apartment is 2 a minute walk to Grand St subway. The area has plenty of character, isn't as sanitized as Bedford Ave. 

The apartment is spacious, well decorated and equipped. We had four people staying here and it was barely a squeeze. Bathroom is nice, water pressure a little low, but workable. Both bedrooms were nice, AC in both rooms plus ceiling fans (if you're staying here in the winter I have no idea what the heating situation is like). There's a huge pull out couch in the living room as well. Kitchen is well equipped although no microwave. 

We stayed here for almost a month and were certainly able to make it our own. The building is nice, very quiet - a few floors walkup. Lucy and Louis were wonderful, and easily contactable throughout our stay. We looked after their cat whom was also very nice. If you're a clean freak, the apartment might appear a little dusty/messy but we had no problems.

So I was staying in his room... I was sharing the apartment with his roomate, who was apparently not very pleased to see a stranger in her place. I barely seen her for the two weeks I was staying there since she was working all the time, which is not a bad thing! When I did see her, I cannot say that she was particularly friendly though. I was not expecting to socialize extensively but, I mean, she barely said hi... We also communicated via text messages, but once again, it was mainly passive/aggressive directives about the apartment.  As a result, I did not feel very welcome in this apartment.
As for the apartment itself, it was not very clean, there was a pretty bad smell in it... I did not have much space in the room for my stuffs. The bed was great however! Very comfortable! The bathroom was like the rest of the place: small, a bit dirty... I was also unpleased to discover that I had to pay for the washing and drier machines (they are not in the apartment itself by the way, but in the basement, and they are shared with the other inhabitants of the building) that were supposed to be part of the offer! When I asked about it, I was basically said that the price was not ""exhorbitant"". Of course it was not ($2.50 each laundry), but I was supposed to be included...
The location of the place was definitely the best thing about it. It was about a 5-minute walk from the north part of Central Park - and pretty much the same amount of time to access the two different subway lines that are around. Regarding the neighborhood, you will find many places around to eat or to shop but otherwise, it is not the best part of Manhattan.  
To conclude, my stay in this place was a mixed experience. I would say that if you intend to find a place only to sleep, a place that has good transport links and that is not so expensive considering its location, Andrew's apartment might be a good solution. Otherwise, you might have to find something else...",60

I had to check in at 8PM and had to make 2 trips to the host's house to meet his roommate. I had to spend the entire day without a place to put my luggage.
The room was kind of clean but very messy.
The bathroom was horrible as it was shared between 4-5 people. I had to wipe the bathroom floor myself so that I could stand on the floor.
I would not stay here again and I am going to ask AirBnB to refund my cleaning charges for this one.",40

My friend and I had to go out and buy cleaning equipment to disinfect and scrub their entire bathroom before even stepping foot in.

We initially stayed at an Extended Stay America hotel near where we live (Hoboken, NJ) but soon figured that it wasn't for us. So we decided to look into Airbnb and we came across Anu's place. 

Our stay at Anu's was awesome. The view was beautiful and seemed to change every hour. It was quite an experience to fall asleep gazing out at the city lights every night and waking up to huge barges pushed by tug boats meandering down the East River... 

Anu's place was super quiet. You literally can't hear neighbors. The floors must be 18"" thick concrete or something... 

Anu's place was clean and warm (it was winter) and welcoming. Every night we stayed truly felt comfortable and nothing like in a hotel. We really felt at home and this had a lot to do with the way Anu set us up and made sure that we knew hot to navigate the building and introduced us to the doormen etc. 

I highly recommend the experience of and Airbnb to anyone, especially if you're doing your own renovation.... It's definitely the way to go. 

We moved out of Anu's place to relocate back to Hoboken to be closer to our on-going renovation... 

We'll let you all know how our stay is at our new Airbnb home once we finally move back into our own (real) place. 

Thanks again Anu!

We were her first listing and there are several things she might want to change.  The listing is not accurate on several items.  The listing says it is 5 minutes from Times Square.  It is more  accurate to say it is a 5 minute walk to the subway entrance, then a 15-20 minute train ride to the Times Square subway stop.  There is no mention of a cat or a fifth floor walk up with no elevator.  There are no real cups or glass for water, only a bowl.  We ran out of toilet paper. There was no trash can in our room or the restroom. There are many personal items left out in the shared bathroom and the hall way. The cat uses the same toilet that you will and you will need to move the litter box out of the bathroom in order to use the facilities or shower.  The neighborhood felt safe and residential.

There is a lovely front room with a view of the street. The apartment is brilliantly placed in the area, a great base to travel the city. I felt welcome on arrival with the charming touch of some chocolates on my pillow and a welcome note. I would definitely book with Henriette again and recommend to others.",100

The other roommates are warm, friendly and welcoming.  Robin gave us guidance on how we can spend our time in New York, and was happy to help when we needed.

The room was reasonably cozy, however the bed could have been more comfortable.  The amenities were as listed, and the bathroom was clean. 

I liked how passionate the housemates where about their art and what they do.  It was a cultural exchange for me more than anything.

The apartment was very clean, the shower great, the beds quite comfortable, and we really appreciated the fruit and chocolates Anna left for us.  

Before we arrived in Brooklyn, it was tricky connecting with Anna.  There seemed to be some glitch with email and texts between Natasha and Anna; but once we connected, communication worked very well. 

The apartment is basement-level, which wasn't clear from the listing.  The entrance is under the front stoop.  We missed having a microwave, as we cooked in several times, but otherwise, the kitchen was well outfitted.  The subway to Manhattan is a half-mile walk.  Everyone we met in the neighborhood was very friendly.  The neighborhood itself is a little run down, without many amenities.

The apartment was as described, very clean on arrival with fresh sheets and brand new towels for us. It was the perfect size for two people in a quiet neighbourhood easily accessible by the subway. I would highly recommend staying here IF you yourself are a cat owner and fully comprehend what living with a cat in a small apartment entails. We were unpleasantly surprised by the amount of cat hair that gathered all over our belongings and selves, despite daily cleaning of the apartment and brushing of the cat. As it is a very small space, the odour of the cat food and litter box was very displeasing and made for a stuffy stay at times. However, cat owners would have been more prepared for these factors and therefore made for a more comfortable stay.

I like to visit my old neighborhood after spending the Holidays with my family in PA, before heading back to Austin. I wasn't planning on making the trip to Brooklyn this year, so I was happy to be able to book Jeff's place rather last-minute. He answered all of my messages right away (while he was traveling in Europe *VERY impressive). Although we did not meet in person, I can tell Jeff is a really cool guy with great style. His place was nicer and more spacious than a Hotel. I especially liked the private balcony and SUPER QUIET block. *No sound of sirens or passing traffic. The decor is modern and the building is very trendy. There is a Door Person 24 hours; They're all very friendly and helpful, which made the Check In/Out process super easy. I felt very safe at all times. You can not beat the location! Jeff's place is only a block from the L Stop at Bedford (one stop from east village)... take it from a local... it's doesn't get any better than that! *It was freezing temperatures during our visit, so it was a relief to not have to walk any distance to the subway. The hip neighborhood has everything, while maintaining a mom-and-pop-shop feel. You can wine and dine on any types of cuisine. I suggest Happy Hour at Le Fanfare (new location branching from Manhattan'd EPISTROPHE), DuMont Burger for lunch, Beacon's Closet for thrift shopping, Brooklyn Brewery for local beers, and House of YES! for dancing and late-night entertainment. Enjoy Williamsburg! And don't forget to tip your servers and bartenders ;)",100

I encourage single travelers and pairs to try Sam's place as it's very conveniently located, as far as the East Village is concerned but also when it comes to walking to the Subway, just 3-6 blocks away, depending on the line.

Some of the comforters and linen looked dirty and the sofa bed wasn't usable at all. We had actually grossed out by it as soon as we unfolded then put it back the way it (Website hidden by Airbnb) of us just slept on the sofa with a bed sheet on.
Even the extra mattress was dirty with stains on it!
Kitchen was pretty functional but no microwave. The stove smelled like gas leaking when lit first but was okay afterwords. 
And because we were there with family, another concern we had was that there was no lock on the bedroom doors.

I came to NYC for an intern so convenience is my priority. The building is old so the heating system is not functioning very well. But thanks to host's roommate Alex, the apt is tidy and cozy. The sound-proof of the apt is not good, I can hear sounds from other apt every night. My room was cold when it was getting cold in NYC and before the storm coming.

That kinda thing really makes you fell like you did a good thing staying there. The room is upstairs which was good because one of the roommates smokes (a lot by the way) so having a place for myself was really great. Rachel seems to be a great girl and I got that sense by talking to people downstairs (there's a great bar right next door.) everyone sad good things about her. The only thing I did not like about ir was the location. Even though it is close to the subway it can be really scary at night and the trains are not so reliable. It usually takes about 20 minutes to arrive. Also it will take about 45 minutes to get to places like Central Park for example or Times Square.

It's an excellent escape from the hustle of Manhattan, and close to some greats bars, shops, and eateries. Lots of great, kind folk walking the streets, too. The apartment space itself was nice-- two stories, high ceilings. The room was upstairs, and one would have to access it through a narrow, spiraling staircase (I wouldn't recommend it if you're lugging heavy baggage or have any back/knee troubles). Bed was comfortable, no closet but I was pretty nonchalant about the latter. Supposedly, hot water would only be available in the upstairs shower at certain portions of the night. I tried to no avail, so I had to resort to using the downstairs bathroom that was shared between the other (Hidden by Airbnb) . Needless to say I had to go in with a can of lysol and clorox wipes-- but hey, at least the water was warm! Still, kind of inconvenient. (Hidden by Airbnb) didn't interact all too much, so if you prefer going about your business then this might be a plus. Walls were pretty thin; I could hear the next door neighbor blasting his/her entire 90's playlist. Come with earplugs, just in case. During the weekend you are bound to get a sampling of it.

He checked in regularly to make sure everything was okay.  He was also very flexible about our check in and check out time which was a HUGE plus. The apartment is in one of my favorite neighborhoods in NYC and a great location. Roku was included so that was nice to have whenever we got home from a long day of being out all day.

The apartment was fine for my friend and I since we spent most of the time out and about and were only really home to sleep. It has a minimalist style going and really just has the essentials but given the price point, location and the fact that it was for NYE weekend made is okay with us! The apartment definitely looks different in the pictures than it does in reality. The set up is different and it is a bit more bare than the pictures appear. But again, we were there for NYE and usually out so we weren't concerned.",80

The shared space is big, two livingrooms, two kitchens, never had to wait to cook or something like that.

Mark and his apartment-mate Josh were great. Very sweet, respectful, easy to contact. Place is a cozy oasis nestled within the hustle bustle of China Town. Perched right in the top floors of a Buddhist temple. 

Know there are 3 flights of stairs (no elevator), and after dark it can get a little ""interesting"" by the outside door. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs and you'll be just fine. Super close to subway, etc. Lyft and cabs were available in a flash. Bed + bedding are super comfy, slept like a baby, felt very safe as a solo female traveler. :)",80

The neighborhood is clean and there are several parks along with the beautiful Manhattan College campus nearby.  There are several food places on the block and in the surrounding neighborhoods.

A couple things to note for interested travelers: The BR has an A/C unit which was a plus to help filter/block some of the street noise below from the restaurant patrons and workers.  The cool setting seemed to work best for regulating the temp.  The bed was quite firm (just an fyi).

After my stay at this beautiful Windsor Terrace apartment, I truly feel it's my home away from home in NYC. First off, Cathy and Tim are fantastic hosts. They responded promptly to every inquiry and supplied everything we needed, including a hair dryer and an air mattress when it turned out my teenage son was too big for the second bed.

The apartment itself is exactly as pictured. Very clean and well-appointed.  The rooms are very large, especially by NYC standards.  The owner of the apartment is a yoga enthusiast who has decorated the space with eastern decorative elements that evoke calm and serenity.  I had my mat with me and had several good practices in the master bedroom!  Bed was medium soft and comfortable.  The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our breakfasts and lunches. Gas range and stove.  There is even a formal dining table where you could easily serve eight.

The neighborhood is family-oriented and quiet.  This is not the place to stay if you want to be near the clubs and the ""action.""  It is the place to stay if you want to be close to town but not in it (great subway access with F and G trains), want to have quick access to a beautiful park (Prospect Park two blocks away), and have all the conveniences close at hand (great grocery and drugstore half a block away).  I had no problem parking my car on the block.  I also felt very safe even coming in late at night by myself (46 year-old female). Cathy and Tim have two dogs who only came out to meet us after we asked to see them.  Other than that, we never heard them!

There was even clothes hung on the door, tampons under the sink, Chargers still plugged in the wall. I stay here with my two year old and I literally spend the whole time in the place trying to keep her out of the hosts things. The closets didn't have doors...just curtains and there were baskets and boxes with stuff in it everywhere. So I would not recommend this for someone with a kid. Besides that it was nice to be able to bring the dog. The location was perfect with a grocery store and Duane Reade less than a block away. It also is NOT a two bedroom. The second bedroom is an open area between the living room and bedroom. I almost had my brother stay with me and I am glad I didn't or he wouldn't have had any privacy.

The key exchange was easy and Elena communicated with us very efficiently from the moment we booked to the moment we arrived. The apartment is in Washington Heights, in a safe neighborhood with grocery/convenience stores very near. It is incredibly spacious compared to what I've seen elsewhere in NYC, and feels very warm and homey. The A/C subway is right downstairs from the building, and then it's a 30-40 minute subway ride needed to get downtown. This might seem lengthy to some, but to me, the size and quality of the apartment made it definitely worth it. Great for people who want to be able to relax at home and cook a meal like real NYC and enjoy a good night's sleep as well as hop around the city.",100

The location is just 3 blocks from the East River with a beautiful and iconic view of the NYC skyline and  easy access to the East River Ferry/water taxi to Manhattan.  Great neighborhood!
   Our host was most accommodating, available to answer any questions and help meet our needs. (even an off hand comment about a night light was immediately addressed)

The listing also said there was a hot tub, and there wasn't. Most importantly, the top lock on the door was broken when I got there, and was never fixed during my one month stay.

Her home is great value, far more reasonable than the NYC Hotels and it also lets you feel like you actually live there for a week instead of visit. All amenities are there. There is a laundromat on the ground floor that is a boon since alot of Brooklyn apartments require you to go out for washing or hand wash. She even gave us a card to use for the machines. I'd recommend this to anyone who's thinking about staying in NYC.

It's small, but not unmanageably so. Robbie actually bought some new shelves and a wardrobe for my friends and I to put our clothes and things! So sweet!

The sleeping conditions are mainly a futon bed, couch (and he bought us a floor mat which we were also grateful for); so not the greatest for a super long amount of time, but especially for a stay shorter than two months, it's fine. 

The location is really great! It's quieter up town and a short walk from the subway. It's maybe a 15 minute train ride down to where time square is, 20-30 to Ground Zero and Soho. It's not hard to get anywhere in Manhattan from his apartment. It's super close to Central Park (North West) which is really nice if you want to get out of the apartment. 

Robbie was out of town for those 2 months, but even with him away, he was available to answer questions and handle any difficulties we had with the apartment. He was really good about keeping up with us!

The linens had hair on them and did not appear freshly laundered. However,  we washed them ourselves with the washer/dryer in the apartment tgat was very convenient. The building seems to have some not sobclean tenants which creates issues as we saw roaches in the stairwell. However, the apartment itself was clean and didn't have a huge problem.

Mark's apartment was great - it's right in the heart of the East Village with many places to eat, drink, and play very nearby. He had the place professionally cleaned before I arrived, and the apartment is spacious, with high ceilings and a wall-sized projector setup (we watched Game of Thrones on it!). Both Mark and I were pretty busy, but we'd usually have a little time to chat when I got home.  

If you're staying with Mark, you should know that the apartment is on the fifth floor and there's no elevator. I regularly walk up five flights of stairs to get to my office, but you should be ready for that exertion.

I stayed at her place when she was on vacation so I only saw her the day I moved in, but she was still an incredibly accommodating host, and her (Hidden by Airbnb) were no less.
Getting around is very simple, but takes some getting use to. It's about a 5 min walk to the G line, which is a couple stops away from a transfer to the ACF lines. Sometimes it's faster to take the bus, which is even closer than the subway.
The place itself is homey, well-decorated, and clean. It's above a grocery store and within walking distance of countless restaurants, a farmer's/flea market on the weekend, and a couple bars. There are washers and dryers in the basement of the building, so laundry isn't an issue.
I stayed through the month of July and, at times, it got a bit hot as her room is furthest away from the AC unit in the apartment. However, it wasn't unbearable and she provided a small fan which helped cool the room at night.
If I ever need a place to stay, I will definitely try to book Tiffany's place again. The ambiance of the apartment makes you feel right at home, and she and her (Hidden by Airbnb) are always willing to help out.",100

We haven't pleasure to see Janea but her brother Lamant have met us and made a small tour around an apartment. He is easy going person, very polite and hospitable, who lives in another apartment at the same floor. He was always ready to help us or give some advice.
The apartment looks totally like at photos and it is surprisedly big even. It is comfy, enough clean and quiet. We have enjoyed our stay.
The apartment is real home, where people do usually live. So it gives the opportunity to discover how some Brooklyn's people do live. We appreciate this point so much.
The area where the apartment is situated gives the chance to see a bit of carribien culture, there are a lot of authentic restaurants, music and so on. However it is real quiet, calm and safe district.
Metro station (lines 2 and 5) is just in 3 mins by feet so you can easy reach any borough of NYC. 
But Brooklyn itself is interesting also with the differences of its districts. 
For example great Prospect park, Brooklyn Botanic garden, Brooklyn zoo, Brooklyn museum are just in 20-30 mins by feet from the apartment. And of course these places are available by public transport.
Also there are some nice grocery stores in 15-20 mins by feet from the apartment.
I can recommend Janea's home because of its hospitable hosts, quiet area and experience to try native people's life which gives that apartment.
Thank you

A good way to save on transport! There are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and there is always someone on the street due to the proximity with NYU - it felt really safe. It's a nice, quiet, residential neighbourhood next door to a beautiful square. It didn't feel like NYC on the street but it's only a few blocks from Soho.
The apartment itself was exactly what we wanted - a home rather than an empty apartment or hotel. The vintage furniture, the wooden floor, comfy sofa... We felt at home, so we even spent a couple of evenings just relaxing! My parents are getting old and it was nice to have a comfy place to go back to, especially on the cold days where it was super nice to be warm :) I was worried that it being a big apartment it may be cold but it was perfect for us.
It is a very big apartment, very well furnished, in a perfect location... which comes at a cost, perhaps we wouldn't have needed so much space, or could have picked a different location, but it was just what we needed and I was glad to have selected this place in the end.

His flat is located in the lovely upper east side; thirty seconds from bars, restaurants, coffee shops and markets.  There are bus stops two minutes away and a subway within ten minutes.  The Upper East Side is very safe, so I didn't feel at all insecure walking home alone at night.  Jack met me the night before I was due at this apartment to exchange keys and we had a quick drink together.  I found him to be pleasant and welcoming - and when I arrived I found a letter from him following up on our conversation about places in NYC I might be interested in visiting and what to do if anything in his apartment was to stop working - a small gesture, but one that made me feel welcome and gave me a sense of security should something go wrong.  Jack and I kept in contact via email throughout my stay as we updated each other on life in different places in the world.  I would definitely stay in Jack's apartment again and recommend him for your trip.",100

The wifi was a free one but it worked very good.   The kitchen had everthing you could wish for cooking but there weren't a table nor a chair for eating.

Perfectly located near multiple metro stations in a hip and happening Caribbean neighborhood with lots of stores, delis, restaurants nearby and most importantly one of the most beautiful parks in the New York Metro Area, Brooklyn's own Prospect Park, with tons of paths, great tracking, exercise areas and playgrounds for the little ones.

The day before we left on our trip he sent me a lot of information on the area, how to get around, and even hospital information.  Even while we were traveling he sent a text wondering how the trip was going and seeing if we had any questions.  When we arrived at the apartment we were surprised at how big it is.  The pictures don't really do it justice.  There are actually 2 bedrooms, one with the king bed and one with the bunks.  Very comfortable accommodations.  Javier left an envelope with some menus from local restaurants and we were able to take advantage of that.  He warned us ahead of time that the garage was a tight fit.  We were in a midsize car and didn't have any problems but if you have a large vehicle it could be a problem.  Quite a few subway stops within 10 minutes walk so we were able to get anywhere in the city that we wanted to with no problems.

The kitchen is stocked with an abundant array of appliances which was much appreciated as we love to cook. The apartment even has a dishwasher! Which is a hot commodity in nyc. The sofa is long and very comfortable in the sitting room and across from it is a large tv with chromecast (very handy for netflix and chill). There are many gorgeous plants dotted around the apartment and the ceilings are very high. The apartment is in a very safe, family-orientated neighbourhood. It is about a 7 minute walk to the train station and there are lots of lovely cafes and restaurants in the area  (must recommend Brooklyn Commune, Lea's and Propellerhead). Our favourite thing to do in the morning is to stop in brooklyn commune and grab and coffee and a bagel for 5 bucks before heading into manhattan (around 20 mins on the trains). The apartment is also about a 3 minute walk to the beautiful Prospect Park (beats central any day in my opinion). There are always activities on in the park and you can even rent out boats in the lake. Anna herself was extremely accommodating and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. She was still easy to contact despite her travelling in Europe.

The 2 windows & fan were very helpful in making my summer experience in humid NYC much more bearable than I had expected.  The owner offered to plug in the window air conditioning unit, which I declined (knowing how noisy that would be).  The room fan was great!  The closet was large enough for my needs.

The room is located in Greenpoint, about a 10 minute walk to McCarren Park and all the good things that Bedford Ave in Williamsburg has to offer. Easily accessible by the Greenpoint Ave. and Nassau G metro stops as well as the Bedford Ave L stop.

The room is clean, has a beautiful view, a very comfy bed and a nice desk. The roof access was a nice plus - a great place to catch an epic Brooklyn sunset.

The common space was not nearly as well kept as the photos show on this listing. There was a good amount of clutter / piles of stuff in corners, dishes left out overnight, etc. and someone seemed to be living on the couch.

The neighborhood is a cool mix of the old and the new: still largely Spanish-speaking with plenty of longstanding businesses, but you're also never far from a nice cocktail lounge if you so desire. I never met Emma as she was out of town, but in our communications she was always very quick to respond, and her roommate Henry is a sweetheart. We had fun sharing a bottle of prosecco while watching the Democratic National Convention on the Apple TV. The apartment itself actually feels bigger than it looks in the pictures and is quite nice, and the bed you'll be sleeping in is very comfortable.

The area was the best part of this place. Its located in a sweet spot between Bedstuy and Prospect, which we loved. So many shops and cheap food stands.

We've spent 4 nights at this place. It was on the 5th floor and the area is not that tourist-friendly but the house itself is actually nice. Yet, I'd have to say the manner of the host extremely upsets us. The husband was nice but the wife was unnecessarily rude. Not a single smile she gave from the very first encounter to the very last. Far from friendly. I'd say one nice thing she did was letting us check in super early - and that's pretty much it.
- We asked for 2 sets of keys when we arrived. She provided them to us but not without constant complaints
- She tried to kick us out before the actual checkout date. She strongly claimed her document said we must leave on 19th, luckily we had a confirmation email that said we were to leave on 20th. After I told her, she raised her eyebrow and frowned noticeably. Then she demanded that we leave early. She complained 'this is too much'. (We were barely home and not noisy at all. What exactly is too much?? And din't we agree on chechkout date in the first place?) You might say it could be a misunderstanding, but her manner showed it all throughout the period of our stay how much she wanted to kick us out.
- 2 rooms: one with ac and the other with a barely working fan. The room is unbearably hot for sleeping. When we talked to her, her answer was 'You get a very cheap price.' So...? We were not staying for free in case you forgot. Cheap or not, you're supposed to let us know beforehand - showing honesty.
- The bathroom! I'm not sure if it's totally normal in NYC but opening a bathroom door even though you know perfectly well there's someone in it is extremely unacceptable to us. My bf's sister was having a shower when she, out of nowhere, just opened the door and walked in.
- She came and knocked the bathroom door loudly every morning - waking us up. The bathroom is right next to the bedrooms. And it didn't happen only once in each day... 
- When we asked how to open the apartment door, instead of teaching us, she gave us an annoying glance and just said it's easy. That's it. Not teaching us how to at all

I'm sorry to say this is the worst airbnb experience so far. I'm honest though. We did not expect 5-stars service but kindness and friendliness would be appreciated rather than a constant frown and ceaseless complaints.",20

The apartment is really lovely and I found it extremely clean when I moved in. You've got everything you need in this self contained studio (including an in-unit washer dryer - very useful!). You also get your own private terrace which is amazing. Every time you walk in the door you're greeted by the friendly doormen and, as a solo traveller, I always felt safe and secure in this building. The location is also excellent, just seconds away from a grocery store, with everything from homeware (Bed bath and beyond) and clothing (chains like Anthropologie/Zara) within easy reach. Highly recommended!",100

We fell in love with the apartment. It was so comfortable, clean and new. Having a washer/dryer in the unit also made everything so much more convenient. 
Although Ryan and Carly were not in the city, they were there anytime we had a question or needed to reach them which really put us at ease. 
We had zero issues with the wifi connection and there was a comfortable TV room for when we felt like staying in and lounging. 
The kitchen is quite beautiful and fully equipped with all of the essentials (we like to cook). There is a Whole Foods around the corner and you are a short walk away from Chelsea Market.
It was such a pleasant stay. Definitely recommend it!",100

I was not able to meet Maria in person but her roommates was kind enough to help me in check in and giving me the 411 in living in their apartment. 

The apartment is in a brown stone. No elevators/lifts. No doorman. It's on the 3rd floor (European standard). Best for light travelers and those who don't get balance issues as the stairs are a bit crooked. The vicinity is next to nice dining places and bars --- so expect some noise at night. Luckily they also gave me some ear plugs. :) 

Had to cut my stay short though as I didn't feel safe because of a break in the apartment below. I traveled with my equipment you see. 

All in all, it was OK.

After reaching out to a few individuals the most helpful one seemed to be Sharon. Although it was a last minute thing on my end, she did not mind. We had set a meeting time for 7 P.M. and I did end up being a tad bit late due to the fact I do not know the city. Thankfully, Sharon only being a phone call away was able to help and guide me towards what ended up being  a magnificent parking spot right near my concert destination and her home. Upon arriving at her door she was smiling, polite, and very friendly. She made everything very comforting. Sharon, my friend, and myself went upstairs to her home and I was entirely blown away. I did not expect that we would be staying in the equivalent of a 4 or 5 star hotel. Her home absolutely beautiful. She offered us all the amenities possible and it was fantastic. I did not for a second regret my decision to get an Airbnb. I think because of Sharon I will use this site again in the future, and when I do travel back to Kings Theatre I will hopefully be staying  at her residence once again.
       Just to give you some insight as to what I loved about her place. It was clean, she was an awesome host. I felt very comfortable and secure at her place. The bed my friend and I had stayed in was hands down the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in my entire life. I could literally lay there all day long.

I definitely would stay here again, in fact, I didn't want to leave!

It looks so much better than the pictures!

It's quite a large apartment by NY standards, with a big kitchen (though no microwave), a bedroom including a beautiful canopy bed, and then a living room with a sofa, big-screen TV, etc.
The entire apartment is designed in an incredible eastern style, with a little meditation corner, lots of greenery, floor cushions, and the faint smell of incense everywhere.
It all combines to create a magical, relaxed atmosphere.

The apartment is on the 2nd floor, so not too much trouble going up the stairs, and the building also has a little back yard you can access.

Catherine was definitely a courteous host, and was even quite flexible with check-in/check-out times, as well as agreeing to extend the original stay (after I saw how amazing the apartment was, I had to add a few more days).

The only small downsides are that the location isn't very close to the subway, and that the apartment is filled with so many things that storage space for the guests is more or less limited to one closet and a couple of drawers.
However, neither of those should be that big of a problem for most people.",100

Heather was out of town all weekend, however Heather's boyfriend Jeremy was an incredible host on his own - certainly one of the best I've ever experienced through airbnb. He was kind and understanding when my bf and I arrived an hour later than expected from the airport, despite our last minute booking and his having plans that evening. And it only got better from there - from procuring an emergency sewing kit to leaving post-hangover vitamins on the kitchen counter for us the morning after we attended a wedding, Jeremy went above and beyond to ensure we had a comfortable stay! He was a friendly and easygoing conversationalist, a truly interesting and engaging personality, and an immensely kind and thoughtful host.

The room is small but decently sized for NY standards, and it was comfortable for two people. I really enjoyed the bright and airy light in the morning, through an ivy-fringed window that we could keep open all day while still having privacy. The apartment is beautiful and had all the amenities one could need. The Clinton Hill neighborhood is adorable (Jeremy had a lot of great recommendations), and its a super quick walk to the G and a very comfortable walk to the C.

I would recommend Jeremy and Heather's place to anyone looking to stay in Brooklyn - amazing hosts, great location, comfort and value make it an airbnb gem!",100

The room is plenty comfortable, with great views of this part of Williamsburg and space to unpack a bit.

He met me when I got there quite late and showed me around. We didn't cross paths again until I was leaving as we were just on different schedules but was extremely friendly.

My room was a good size with lots of light. It's over a main street, so if you struggle with noise, it might be too loud. I found it fine and I normally struggle with sleep.

The location is fab. Very safe. Close to a few different subways that'll get you into Manhattan very quickly.

Walkable to many foodie spots. Definitely worth a smoothie at Grass Root. Excellent coffee at Devocion and The charterhouse. Interesting drinks at The End. Good brunch at Sugarburg.  Fab dinner and natural wines at The Four Horseman. So many more places I wanted to try.

Will definitely be back to NYC and if I'm travelling solo I'd stay here again.",100

Location was excellent, and close to a variety of amenities and public transport. Whilst in no way a surprise, it is worth noting that this is very much the hosts' full-time living space, so this is at the 'staying at your mates house whilst he is away' end of the AirBnB spectrum, and living amongst someone's every-day belongings. Worth noting too that there is no access to a kitchen area, so no fridge, kettle, iron etc. There is also minimal natural light (important for make-up, so I am told!).

There are beautiful big windows and skylights throughout the house: there is one in the room which was great, it made the room feel really open and bright. We felt so welcomed from the very start - it was very much a ""home away from home"". They have two cats who are both so cute and friendly, we loved them! Kasia and her sister were beyond helpful and we couldn't be more thankful for all their suggestions and help with directions to trains, restaurants, etc., without their help it would've been a much different experience - they really helped make our trip the best it could be. Kasia was super flexible with the check-in and check-out times which was amazing.

All beds are air beds..but I requested a normal bed as I got back pain after one night. He did get one for me. So 5 stars for that. He does come and open the door as guest don't get a key. He provides water, toiletries and towels. Noise is an issue. Walls are thin and you will bother others if you watch a movie. Basically be careful while watching movies or doing things . Location and price is good for New York. With low advertised prices my total was ~$80 per night, which is good for NYC I guess.",60

We just spent a lovely week at the airbnb of John & Siri in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, NY. It is located on a quiet, beautiful, tree-lined street in a row of brownstones. The apartment is on the ground level of the brownstone making it very accessible for people who may have a problem with stairs as we do. The apartment is lovely, clean and spacious with a large living room, eating area, bathroom, kitchen and bedroom.  The owners were very kind and thoughtful to leave us a nice bottle of wine, chocolates, coffee, milk, bread, butter and eggs as a starter and let us use any of their condiments we needed. With the use of Uber, we found it very easy to get around Brooklyn and to the city. The subway was only a block or two away also. Also nearby are all the shops we needed within walking distance. 

Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your home for a week. We enjoyed it very much and hope to use it again in the future.",100

The only thing I'd warn others about is there is some noise pollution, it is the city after all.

He was gone for most of my stay there, so we actually had the apartment to ourselves most of the time.

(Upon our arrival, she had a bottle of Moscato for my husband and I to enjoy for his first visit to NYC.) Her home was quaint, quiet (even though you are super close to the above ground subway train - its literally a 3 min walk), and lovely. She has everything you could need to prepare something, although we rarely used the kitchen... there was WAY too much amazing food for me to be cooking, and Danielle also has a list of her fav restaurants and take out food in the area. This came in handy on our late and exhausting arrival to NYC. The place is PERFECT for a couple looking to getaway. The shower/ bathroom is amazing!! And she even offered bathroom necessities, such as soap, bubble bath, etc. Also, if you were to leave anything at home, you are (again) a 3 min walk from a Rite Aid, a beauty supply, and a REALLY good coffee shop (I wish I could remember the name!)

The home IS Danielle's home, but she was kind enough to clear everything away, so that my husband and I could use her storage areas. Literally, the ONLY thing I would make a comment about is the bed. It is definitely a firm mattress. If you own a firm mattress, that will not be a problem, but for me being that we sleep on a pillowtop, it took a bit of adjusting. However, I would DEFINITELY recommend Danielle's place a 100%! I hope she continues to host! Everyone she experience her loveliness and her little Bushwick Retreat.",80

The location is also superb in many ways; it's right next to both the subway and within walking distance of a terrific set of restaurants (mainly soul food). On the other hand, the apartment is also near a hospital - and so the main downside to its location is that the neighborhood is a bit noisy, even for Manhattan. Our stay was a bit unusual in that we used the apartment for BOTH lodging and work. So during the day, we used the main showroom (that's pictured in his profile) for a strategic planning meeting, and it proved to be a terrific and creative space for us - which was a huge bonus.",80

The room is a bit old, but cozy, well-decorated and artistic. Sometimes we heard load noises upstairs, but probably it's because of the New Year celebrations. The neighborhood is safe, lively and very close to metro. We loved the Bagel Pub a lot, and it's a great place to grab a cup of coffee and fresh bagels for breakfast.

We were tired from a long drive, and in NYC it's not easy to find somewhere else. When we got in touch with her, she had the urge to offer us a discount and at that discount we bought an inflatable mattress. THE PHOTOS DO NOT CONDIT WITH THE OFFERED SITE! THEY ARE FALSE. Absurd. After a long time she got a room in the same building, however who was going to be my wife, my 12 year old daughter and me. We had to sleep apart.

Let me say that this alone made my trip so much easier. I was in Manhattan in midtown Manhattan 10 minutes from the time I got out the door. You literally take the stairs up from the subway and the door to the apartment building is right there!!!

The location is simply amazing, so many places to eat and grab drinks just within 2 blocks of the apartment. This is the really ""happening"" area of Williamsburg.

Apartment is long which I like since I was with another couple, made sharing the unit very easy! Everything was very clean, updated, and to my expectations. The apartment was large relative to many others I've stayed in the area. Bedrooms were massive and really didn't feel cramped up at all.

Metrobutler was our contact and the service was exceptional. They sent me a welcome email that covered everything, greeted us at the apartment, answered all my questions, and I had a contact the entire time to tend to any concerns.

Can't wait to come back!!!",100

Location was absolutely on spot - metro station down the building, 2 blocks away to Flat Iron Building, wine shop and grocery around the area.

Apartment is wonderful. Situated at 16th floor, thus you have a New York skyline of the neighbourhood. The feeling of walking around the cracking parquet floor may be annoying to others but for us, it added a little charm to the place.

Terrace - a plus. Amazing to have used it.

He actually took the majority of our stuff upstairs (my daughter's suitcase was heavy too)...we had a lot of stuff. The picture does not do the room (Website hidden by Airbnb) doesn't show how large the room is. There was plenty of storage and he has a small refrigerator in the room along with a huge bean bag and a chaise lounge. And that TV! The house has two bathrooms, so there were no problems getting ready for work. The guys in the house are great and were extremely welcoming. I actually hated to leave. I was hoping his job would need him to move and I could just keep the room. The neighborhood is perfectly safe and everyone was friendly. Fifth Avenue has everything you'll ever need including a bus stop and Fourth Avenue has the rest..including the subway. Restaurants, Rite Aid, Duane Reade, banks, grocery stores, and shopping (clothing, shoes, beauty supplies) on Fifth Ave...laundry, delis and grocery stores are on fourth.

I was very disappointed because of : the apartment was messy, there was a lot of dust everywhere, we find a dead mouse in the kitchen, even the toilet seat was not clean. Everything was quite rustic.
I burned myself against a heating myself against the heating pipe in the bathroom, seems to be common apparently in NYC but James didn't warn me, so now I have to deal with a mark on my shoulder for my whole life.
On top of that, the landlord wanted to kick us from the apartment for no reason, apparently we were making noise and we didn't turn off the light of the entry stair, thas was a lie and he just told us that he will throw our luggages out if there was another problem, saying that he doesn't care about the Airbnb situation. 

The only advantage of this Airbnb is that is closed to te metro subway to get to New York and that we can park the car. There is also a lot of commodities near the apartment, you have all the sunny side area with restaurants market etc.

I would advise to others Airbnb that this is only for adventurers, maybe for 2 days and that is going to be expensive and you cannot expect something amazing. 
I will not book again if I could.",40

Though the reservation was confirmed and money withdrawn from my account, there was absolutely NO communication with the host. I messaged her a few days before my arrival and even the morning of without receiving any response. I then arrived in NYC close to 7:30 PM and knocked on the host's door three times. NO response. I contacted Airbnb twice that day and even their specialists were unable to reach her. Did I mention it was 13 degrees Fahrenheit outside and the winds were gusting terribly? Since there was no way of rebooking an affordable Airbnb immediately, I ended up spending two hours working with Airbnb to book a hotel for that evening and an Airbnb for the remainder of my stay. The only redeeming factor about this booking was their neighbors. They let us sit in their warm living room for two hours because we almost got frostbite and needed a place to charge our phones to call Airbnb. While there, these neighbors informed us that 1) this host spent all of that day moving out and that 2) she and the other person whom she lives with were very likely running a brothel out of their apartment.

Upon arrival I was told we were booked for a studio the first night, 2bedroom suite the second night and a 1bedroom the third night.  I was able to contact the host through internet quickly but the situation was only able to be corrected to a 1 bedroom suite and queen/queen hotel room on different floors.  I caution people booking that they may not receive exactly what they believe they are reserving.  I appreciated the quick answering of my frantic call but was upset that I did not get what I paid for, it was pricey for what amounted to 2 separate hotel rooms instead of a bedroom suite. I did receive an extra night because I was stranded with Hurricane Irma causing flight cancellations but I believe it was not enough for the stress and delay caused. The wyndham staff indicated that this was a common problem with airbnb and its property, not specifically this host but airbnb in general, so on my next trip I will book elsewhere.",60

The neighbourhood is filled with great bars, restaurants and eateries.  I like the real feel of the neighbourhood, and it is close to many other interesting parts of Brooklyn.

The bathroom is on the small side so if you're a bigger person, this might be something to consider.",100

This is something that I really thought cool: if you need for any reason to move to another Outpost house, you can if they have a bed available. The places are nice, you can save some money with food because people always let something when they left. You may have some issues with train lines after 10pm, and on weekends, because some lines stop working or just delay more than the usual so be prepared. People on Bedford's house was amazing and made my staying at the house and in NY better and funnier. They are always having some party or celebration with all the houses, time to time.

The apartment is a fair size smaller than what we expected (largely due to some flattering angles in photos).  It is however in a brilliant location in the West Village.  Comes with all the basic necessities (bathroom, shower, iron, fridge, full size bed etc).  No TV (but the host notes this in the listing).  

Bedroom is located street facing.  So if you're a light sleeper I suggest ear plugs.

The place could use a once over cleaning wise before guests arrive (bathroom/shower wasn't clean, apartment was dusty).  The check in process needs work (we were not given the correct keys and had to stay in a hotel the first night, which was refunded by the host).  Aside from that if you're looking for a quaint home base to drop your things and rest your head whilst exploring the city, this is the spot.",60

The ladies were so nice and driven. Though I only stayed a few days and was in and out at a conference, it felt like a family. I would definitely love to stay here again if I were in NYC.

16965316,203716401,2017-10-15,148371183,"Jack","Where do I even begin? This stay was wonderful. 
I couldn't check in at the time I originally had stated, and David was super accommodating and made check in really easy for me. The apartment is in a fantastic location, with the Q's 94th street entrance being less than a block away; it made my commute to work take barely 20 minutes. The roommates were wonderful, both had been there for over a month, so I'm not sure if they're a more permanent fixture, but I promise you'll get along well with them. Beautiful people who I have made lasting friendships with. 

The room is comfortable, if not exactly large. There's plenty of closet/storage space available, drawers for a more extended stay. One of the outlets is non-functioning and another was behind the dresser so I had to move the dresser over a few inches to access it, but there is an extension cord next to the bed so charging one's phone/laptop/various accouterments isn't an issue even if you don't use the outlet behind the dresser. The desk in the room is very small, but adequate for a laptop. The bed was luxurious, the linens freshly cleaned on my arrival.

For that matter, the entire apartment was very clean, presumably due to a joint effort of the tenants and David himself. I wasn't there long enough to actually meet David; one of the roommates helped me check in, but apparently he brings by toilet paper/cleaning supplies/occasionally foodstuffs/etc. which I found very convenient. 

All in all, I can't recommend this place enough. 5 stars across the board; If I thought I could afford it on a monthly basis, I don't know if I would ever leave.",100

The apartment was just as described 
It's is an older building so there is obviously work to be done but it is well maintained. We had an issue the first night with plumbing around 12am! Thankfully Dioni was immediately responsive even for such a late emergency call. 
It's only a four story residential building and the landlord was very nosy and so was the primary reason of most discomfort. Its an uncomfortable sense of being watched or needing to hide. 
There is smoking in the building so during the first two weeks my clothes carried an unwelcome scent. Yet nothing that fresh air and perfume couldn't solve. 
Other than that, the apartment is very close to the train (2 blocks) that you can actually watch the train go by at night from the bedroom and living room windows! 
Her decor is very charming and the neighborhood felt very safe and well situated near markets, shops, and restaurants. Dioni is a very gracious hostess and allowed us to use anything in her place that was of convenience. (Read: eggs)

The room was very clean and comfortable but just a note to business travellers, it's tiny and doesn't have any closet space (for instance, if you have to wear a suit or formalwear there will be nowhere to hang it.)

It was very modern and stylish which for me was important. The price is great for two-three people as you can easily split the cost however if you're traveling alone it might be a little much. Alejandro was extremely clear in his instructions for check-in and check-out. The location is EXTREMELY for a visit to NYC as is it is in the middle-lower part of manhattan with east access to other parts of NYC. I'm glad to have spent my Pride weekend with Alejandro.

The flat mates are very nice and Sean was a very accommodating and flexible host. The location is excellent and one should go out and explore from the location (one will not really want to spend more time here than necessary - it is acceptable in cleanliness and the bed is comfortable, but not such a pleasant place to hang out). 

So, would recommend, but only as a bed. Also, read the description - do not expect a super clean apartment, people actually live here. I suppose that this would qualify as an ""authentic""  New York living experience",80

However, when he finally did send a message, it was 5:11pm and when I responded, he said that the office closed at 5:30pm & that he would be gone for the weekend. 

After the weekend, I decided to stay on and apart from the view of the neighbors across the way, I enjoyed the central location, the ease of entry, cleanliness, and well fitted apartment.

The doormen welcomed us into the building family on day one.  Beautiful kitchen and home we might choose if we moved to the city.  This allowed us to pretend like we were real New Yorkers.  The Metro was very convenient and we used it daily.  You'll want to get an unlimited Metro pass for the duration of your stay. The location isn't in the heart of major tourist sights but Central Park is just a short walk away and it is spectacular.  Being on the upper West Side makes for quieter streets yet still innumerable dining options. This living, breathing home is exactly the from which I like to experience a city.  By the last 48 hrs of my one week trip people were asking me directions in the park, on the street and on the subway.  That makes this stay very successful by my criteria.  I cannot recommend this property highly enough.  You won't be diappointed.  Ideal for a families because of 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms and modern kitchen.  Nice urban neighborhood.

The room is terrible, dirty. Kitchen is completely impossible to cook or eat unless u are okay with food poisoning. Shower wearing some shoes unless u want an infection.

The beds were comfortable (with the exception of the sofa bed) and there was plenty of room to hang clothes in the upstairs bedroom. We enjoyed preparing meals in the large kitchen. The massive dining table was spacious for us. 
Kimberley was quick to respond to any request. The hairdryer broke and a new one purchased the next day! 
We met Kimberly and she was very hospitable and friendly. 
During the stay 2 couples (at different times) had booked the additional room meaning that 7 people were in the apartment at one time. This didn't seem to be a problem as our schedules didn't clash. The downstairs toilet was helpful. It was great to meet fellow travellers. 
Initially the heating was very efficient however as the temperatures dropped and a snow storm hit we felt the cold. 
The noise from tenants from other apartments was the only other downside. The wooden floorboards were loud and the music and conversations could be heard from the bedroom. 
A short walk to the Metro and around 20 minutes into Manhattan. We didn't really explore the area but spent most of our time in the city. Uber was cheap to use also.",80

The neighborhood is totally safe. You can walk around at 3 am in this very racially diverse area, much like where I grew up, so I felt at home here. There is a laundry mat a block away next to a grocery store and Rite Aid and a rent a car (but who needs one!)  A few blocks the other way there are a few 99 cent stores and great places to eat. I loved the Wig store! How fun. Great prices and friendly people. Bought 3 wigs! The other areas of town are close by bus as well, and the train station is close by. I do a lot of Airbnb, and this was by far the best place to stay, as far as transportation, in all my history of traveling.     

This is an old building built in the 1920 and in need of repair, so do not expect polished perfection. She is working on fixing it up. I love old buildings, was raised in one, so it was great for me. Felt like home. So much character. She has the room on the first floor and Airbnb on the second floor. Tenants on the upper floor, but I rarely saw them. I stayed in the shared room, but no one was here at the same time so I had the whole second floor to myself. The bed was comfy. I especially loved the big claw foot bath tub. So nice to soak in!     

There is a fridge and freezer in the tiny kitchen and a gas stove. Yay gas! And a microwave and toaster oven and bottled water. She provided snacks, and so I barely needed to buy extra food except for dinner as I tend to be a snacker anyhow.      

So I will be staying here again. A wonderful lady and so convenient to get around. Give it a try!",100

The building has a minimal gym for basic exercise and has a decent place for doing laundry. 

In the apartment, there is a strong smell of incense which some may like and others not.

18843814,175338719,2017-07-28,77136775,"Cathy","I think she had good intentions, but this is not a place that should be rented out for long term stays. Firstly there was a fly problem that may have been caused by the multiple leaks in the ceiling. The kitchen sink was not suitable for cooking in the way that common kitchen sinks are. Also there was  a dust problem with the air conditioning.  Additionally the shower water pressure was bad so it was not ideal for someone who wants to stay for a month at least. And the shower also leaks a lot. Furthermore the air conditioning had to be on at all times because the windows couldn't be opened. Also one of the air conditioners was leaking and it got on all of my clothes. I was also expected to personally pay someone to come clean the apartment which isn't really usual for airbnbs. Sometimes people will charge a small cleaning fee but take care of that themselves. And there was also the added expectation that I take care of her plants but I wasnt told soon enough to be able to properly care for them.
So some things just need to be changed. Overall, the apartment is a nice size, nicely decorated, easy to keep clean, and close to transportation (for the most part). It was nice that she allowed pets. She also has a giant bookcase for those who like to read.",60

Even though Heather and her family were about to leave for their holiday, they accepted our booking request and got their home ready for us. 

I couldn't have been happier with the way things turned out! Especially with the cold spell that NYC experience while we were there.

Heather's place is right around the corner from the C train and just two stops away from transfers that will take you wherever you need to go in the city. We were grateful not to have to walk far to get to the subway or buses. It was also helpful to be able to run to Fulton St for quick errands and food. The location is wonderful. 

Heather's home itself is also great. As soon as we walked it, we were struck with how light and airy the apartment felt (while being wonderfully warm!!!). The space is well used and easy to navigate. It is beautifully decorated, so that you feel like you are home (or at least the version of home that you always intend to create but don't ever seem to have the time to : ), but not overwhelmed by someone else's stuff.

18973030,165354705,2017-07-01,111583870,"Nastya","I definitely don't recommend this apartment. That was my first (and I hope last) bad experience of renting on Airbnb.
Our host (his name is Tal) wasn't at the apartment the time when we (me and my boyfriend) were staying there. It couldn't be a huge problem if he helped us to solve all the problems we faced there. And we asked him to help us. He said he couldn't do anything cause he was not there! So instead of 2-months staying we decided to cancel the second month.
Now I want to list the main problems we faced at that apartment.
1) Dirty bathroom. 
The floors, the shower were really dirty. No one cleaned it before our arrival and during our stay there. 
2) Noise, smoking marijuana and nonstop partying even at the night time!
Guys who live there had noisy parties in the kitchen every single day! They smoked marijuana and that smell was even in our room! We also cooked our food while they were smoking..
3) We had to buy the small pull-down table to eat in our room. Cause the kitchen was always full of people: the people who live there and their friends.
4) We couldn't cook pork and shrimps.
The host didn't report beforehand (and didn't mention this in the description) that they all did eat kosher food. So we couldn't cook it. 
5) The host texted us not to use the big trash can in the kitchen cause we didn't throw the trash away. But we haven't used it at all.
6) He also texted us not to use the main barthroom (except the shower). So we used the main barthroom only to have a shower.
7) We couldn't use the dishwasher (it was in the description) cause the guys of the apartment asked us to wash the dishes by hand. It wasn't a big deal for us, and we washed it after every single use but the host put the info about the dishwasher in the description.
There were not all the problems we had at that place. I just listed the most huge ones. 
The place was totally uncomfortable and unsafe (we didn't have the key of our room. And the apartment was full of many people every day).",40

emilia and zak's place is in extremely close proximity to some great neighborhood parks, and just as close to the L train. getting to manhattan was a breeze and the commute time was great. if you're interested in an authentic brooklyn experience, helpful hosts, a ton of living space, an awesome back patio and an all around wonderful experience, this is place is definitely a winner!  plus their sons are adorable!",100

When my flight landed around noon, I messaged the host stating I was going to grab lunch and then head over to check in but she said she just saw my reservation to stay at her place and that she would not have the room ready until 8 pm that day. I gave the benefit of the doubt since I paid only a few days earlier and all I had was a backpack, no luggage, so I did not mind moving some plans around to check in later. But then she said she had a date at 9 pm giving me a narrow check in time and not being accommodating towards me whatsoever. She said would call me when she was heading home. 8 PM came and no call was ever given, I tried calling the host and she did not respond until I got Airbnb involved and I had to cancel the stay. She finally said that a mistake occurred and that she was out of town for the weekend, forcing me to find another place to stay late in the day. I am not exactly sure how the room and location are but I would be more understanding if the host had canceled on me in the beginning when she found out my reservation got accepted somehow, but she was unprofessional and I find it unacceptable how I was treated.",20

It is very close to world financial center/Brookfield place where my husband works and ground zero/the oculus. There is just so much to do, see and eat in the area. Ultimately, we chose Kim's Airbnb because we needed two bedrooms and a washer/dryer while traveling with our 16 month old. The second bathroom and huge living area were an added bonus! The older elevator was a touch tricky for us with a stroller but at least there was one. There is a no shoes policy which I appreciated because we don't wear shoes in our home either.

We felt a bit gross walking barefoot in the bathroom and the sitting area was not usable as there were piles of stuff on the couch etc. I'm guessing this is a shared place with several roommates, but we had no idea who else was staying or if the other bedrooms were Airbnb guests as we never met anyone and just came and went with a door lock key by ourselves. This didn't make us feel secure about leaving any of our stuff, so we just left in the morning and toting suitcases around to breakfast. It also doesn't seem reasonable to leave a pet cat without the owner being there...we have cats and are very used to them, but I didn't expect to be left with someone else's pet. Although he was very sweet, he woke us up all night wanting to come in and out of the room as his owner wasn't around. This felt more like borrowing a key to an empty frat house than an Airbnb.",40

Communication with the two was extremely easy - they went above and beyond to make a group chat so that one of them would always be able to answer any/all questions at whatever time. We let them know that we couldn't find their blow dryer upon arrival, so they made sure to stop by while we were out and surprised us by leaving it in a noticeable spot. This simple gesture was more than enough to show what kind and sweet hosts they were. 

Their apartment was absolutely beautiful - plenty of space for the three of us to stay, and everything was cozy and inviting. The location was just a few minute walk to public transit, and there were plenty of local restaurants, delis and shops nearby as well.

As described,  it has a nice yard with a barbecue grill.   Fabrice was nice enough to leave us coals for the grill.   The apartment has a well-equipped kitchen combined with a dining room.  There is no living room per se.   The neighborhood is lively with outdoor cafes by the park.   The street is very quiet but close to a commercial street where one can find everything.   The subway station is around the corner with easy connection to Manhattan and the US Open.   We did not meet Fabrice in person but he checked with us by phone.

There's a dining table, dresser, fridge and kitchen was complete with plates, pans, and silverware BUT PLEASE clean it very well or boil on a hot water since kitchen cabinet has a lot of baby roaches.  (literally killed 6 of them) There's a 1 full size bed and two sofa beds.  It was 3 of us so host was very kind to buy an extra bed for the 3rd person instead of letting him sleep on the sofa bed. Wifi connection was good as well. There's a TV but we couldn't figure out how to make it work since remote was not working or we just don't know how to set it up but no big deal. Bathroom was clean but the shower space was too small so the water keeps on leaking from the door so it makes the bathroom floor wet and they don't have extra floor towels. Lots of hangers. Ask host to bring garbage bag upon check in. Our stay was awesome. Will definitely recommend to my friends if the room is available.

The living room (which is your room) is a good size with a desk and coffee table. Keianna really respects your space. It almost felt like I was in a studio apartment. The kitchen is very small but there is everything you need there to make a meal. The bathroom is in Keianna's bedroom so you have to go in there but she is happy to let you in whenever. She does have a cat that likes to explore which I found slightly annoying but not really a big deal. The apartment is a few blocks from both the A and 1 trains which is very convenient.  However, when going out, communicating when you are coming back can help prevent you having to wait outside since the door is hard to open. Any problems you have, you can go to Keianna and she will try her best to resolve it! She is a great host and has a wonderful space. There are some minor drawbacks but my experience there was well worth the money. I would definitely recommend staying there.",80

She helped us arrange a small AC when temperatures reached 35'C at night as it gets very WARM in the apartment - I highly recommend to get a place with proper AC if you are not used to this type of temperatures - and fixed sudden issues with the internet rightaway. 

The apartment itself is on the third floor (no elevator for those who care) and spacious, but rather dated and in need of a bit of a refresh. So if you are looking for a spotless shower/clean modern bathroom, this won't be the right place for you. 

The location is fantastic, it's in the heart of Brooklyn's Park Slope area, right on 7th Ave, with everything walking distance, loads of restaurants, independent stores and cafes. The subway (7 Av) is a 5 minute walk away which takes you direct into Manhattan within 20-30 mins.",80

Not only they showed me the best places to eat and drink, but Sidra actually helped me prepare for my job interview, which I got an offer from them. I was extremely intimidated by moving to NYC, but Chelsea and Sidra made my life so content that I was ready to chase my dreams and goals in NYC.

19803186,233704419,2018-02-10,8962972,"Lisa","I have been using Airbnb all over the world and have never had a bad experience -- until I rented Yohan's apartment.  There were no reviews yet and that made me wary so I contacted him directly.  I was coming into town with my 82 yr old dad, husband and niece from Boston.  It was my daughter's birthday and I wanted to host a family and friends dinner -- which I told Yohan.  I even asked the square footage of of the apartment.  He said 1,400 sq ft, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms -- it sounded great.  When I arrived a manager met me there and brought me up to a TINY 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apt with a tiny kitchen and eating nook.  I thought the manager made a mistake.  When I showed him photos of the apartment I had rented he looked at me and said there was someone in that apartment.  I was furious.  We called Yohan and suddenly the story changed.  ""A pipe broke and there was water damage and he tried to call me.""  NONE OF THIS WAS TRUE.  Obviously I could check my phone to see if he called.  He didn't.  Nor did he text or email through AIRBNB.  Nothing.  Then, when I wanted to sit in the tiny apartment to use the wifi and try to find another apartment that would fit my family he said NO.  Awful, awful.  He actually told me to go to a Starbucks with all my bags. My assumption at this point was that his apartments (he has several) were not cleared by the building. This guy is the worst.  As I said I use Airbnb all the time (you can check reviews of me) and this is the first bad experience I have had.  It ruined our whole trip which ended up being way more expensive in so many ways because this apartment fell through.",20

Everything worked well, wifi, TV, stove, heat etc. and was easy to adapt to.  We loved the neighborhood and the street is quiet and tree lined.  The living room was simply and beautifully decorated for the Holidays which we really appreciated.

Just two smallish complaints:
*Morning coffee: (we were 3 and definitely need that one cup on cold winter mornings).  There was only a Nespresso machine (yay!) but no capsules.  We checked in afternoon of Dec. 24th so no way to even buy capsules till the 26th.  We made due by buying coffee for a few days at a dinner and saving it in the frig to reheat.  Also, I drank my coffee out of a child's plastic mug since there were only dainty teacups in the house, and very few at that.  
*Shampoo etc: There was sufficient gel soap in the master bath (no bar soap) but only baby shampoos etc in the second bedroom.  The person sleeping there felt bad using up what little was left so we just shared back and forth every day.  A little inconvenient.  For such an elegant place one expects the small amenities to be standard in each bath.
Bottom line it's a great location and a stylish, comfortable home.  Just remember that the owner is French and the accommodations are in a European style.",80

The apartment was very clean and simple. Decors were very pretty and romantic. We loved sitting down and chilling on the rug in the living room. PC was available to use for us so it would be very useful anyone who comes to visit NYC without one. I wish I could use the private backyard more but it was too cold to be outside since it's winter.

This flat was neat, a good size and has everything a guest needs: air conditioning (a must for NY in the summer time), small but useful kitchen, fridge/freezer (important for me, for medication), Apple TV/Netflix (which helped on days I was not well and couldn't do any tourism), towels and bed linen and two lifts to the 6th floor. I liked this flat location because it was 4 minutes walk to my appointments as well as being right next to Central Park (2 mins walk), the Metropolitan Museum (16 mins), the Guggenheim (24 mins), a supermarket for basic needs e.g. bottled water, breakfast cereal, milk etc (Food Emporium, not the best for fresh foods like fruit, vegetables and meat - 8 mins), a Whole Foods store (better for fresh, organic fruit and vegetables etc. - 19 mins), a pharmacy (Metro pharmacy - 6 mins) and two subway stations to all the necessary tourist places (6 mins or 15 mins). Some things to note that will help your stay: 1) make sure you ask if the flat has been cleaned before you arrive, 2) make sure your international credit cards are functioning (the Metro pharmacy only swipes the cards and does not allow a chip insertion). If you need to unblock your card and are calling an international 24hr number, make sure you use ""+"" instead of ""00"" before the country code of your country to reach your credit card customer services. 3) Make sure that you change your currency to US dollars in your own country because both the airports and exchange bureaus in town are super expensive! 4) Food quality: I am used to Swiss/European standards of food so it was difficult to find 'normal' or good tasting fresh fruit, vegetables or meat. I also would recommend, if you are a coffee lover (bring your own instant coffee if you cannot make it fresh). In general food is very expensive with poorer quality than in Switzerland so be prepared to either eat out or cook expensive ingredients. 5) Subway passes: if you are staying a week or more, the best would be to get a 1 week subway pass (34 US dollars) that can be 'charged' so keep the card, it can be re-used. 6) rental cars for travel in other cities or states: it is better to travel by cab/taxi to Newark airport or JFK to get a rental car (70 US dollars per day instead of 120 from the middle of NY) from there than getting one in the city. All rental car companies want to see a credit card even if you have already paid online. Everything is paid by credit card (more than...",100

Room that I rented was small and clean with a window that I felt comfortable leaving open for the fresh air. She provided linens and towels. 

The shared spaces were accessible, but shared with roommates and their stuff, so reminded me a bit of when I was in college and my mid 20's.  Didn't bother me at all, but is something that future renters might want to know.

This parking garage ruffled through our vehicle and extra bags during the 2 nights we paid for. Please arrive during the day to ensure street parking is available to you infront of this location. Also, please confirm with Emily that her bed is fixed before booking as we paid a pretty pricey amount to sleep on a broken and squeaky bed.

The second night was NYE, but the first night was an otherwise unremarkable saturday, so is presumably typical for that night of the week (as confirmed by schedule gleaned from club's (Hidden by Airbnb) feed).

- second bedroom lacks privacy with glass doors
- hosts made no space for us in cupboards wardrobes etc despite us staying for seven nights 
- bathroom shower quickly clogged and we had to buy unblocker
- we had to receive a large delivery for the host unpack and refrigerate the contents of some of the boxes  
- the host got upset when we had a delivery made to the apt of it own
- had to look after a needy cat that broke into second bedroom every night as well as water plants (we agreed to this before staying to be fair)

None of these issues in isolation would be a problem but cumulatively we were left with the impression we were paying a premium price to cat sit for friends who had to leave their apt in a rush. Just generally felt a bit sloppy. Perhaps it's their first time so I hope they'll improve the experience for future guests",60

The bed was not very comfortable, too soft for us, and the bead base was very noise. The apt. works well for one or two persons. The internet worked well until the last two days of our staying when it didn't worked at all. Check-in and check-out were flexibles and we appreciated it a lot.
One day before leaving we had a trouble with the apartment door's lock, we couldn't make the deadbolt turn it was quite old and it got stuck, so we communicated with our hostess who was in Europe at that time, but she did no much to help us, so after one hour or so, we decided to call a locksmith in order to get in, but we had to pay for it and it was quite expensive; when we asked our hostess if she would be willing to share that expense she refused to pay anything arguing that we where the ones who had broken the lock, something that we didn't do, so once we finished our trip I wrote Airbnb about the incident and they agreed with me that the one who has to be responsible for that kind of inconvenience is the host or the landlord building, so now I'm still waiting to get our money back from that expense or at least part of it.",40

The neighborhood had everything we needed (grocery stores, wine, print shop, and many great restaurants).   The room had a comfy bed, very clean, and had its own air conditioner (which came in handy since it was still hot outside for early October).

Village had great bars and eateries and not a chain-restaurant in sight. Famous John's Pizza is about a one minute walk. And you're still just a 15 minute subway ride from Midtown or the southern tip of the island, so you're pretty well situated.

You do need to be good at stairs, as five flights up requires energy. But it worked for me just fine. And the view is worth it. Bring some earplugs, which can be useful for random noise from the otherwise quiet side street.

The apartment is bigger than it looks in the pictures, that was a nice surprise. It has one small bedroom with a bed, another room with a couch and a TV, and a living room where curtains separate the second bed from the dining table.
Kitchen is fine. A microwave would add a few points.

Our stay was problematic, since after a very cold day, the bathrooms pipes froze. Danielle and Paul were extremely understanding and proactive to get us to a hotel for a night and then reimbursed us in full, since we had to leave the apartment only a couple of days after our arrival.

I was contacted and responded to very quickly and accurately. Opening the door can be confusing but she gave me exact directions and it opened on the first try. Also, there are two buildings you will know your in the wrong one if it shows only 2 floors avaible. This part was confusing but luckly it only had 2 floors which made us think we were in the wrong building. The numbers on these particular buildings are only in chinese. Unless, I did not locate it ..over all...beautiful, clean, safe,and very hospitable. Highly recommended if you dont plan on sitting in .",100

The hosts- I only met brad briefly when I picked up the keys, but he was very laid back and welcoming. He was also very responsive over messaging during our entire stay, despite his 5 hour time difference. 

The location- the apartment itself is located on a peaceful, tree lined street, yet is only a block from one of my favorite streets in Williamsburg. You'll be within a leisurely stroll to some of Brooklyn's best bars and restaurants, as well as so many cafes, (vegan!) Delis, grocery stores and the L train subway stop, or even the ferry to manhattan... you honestly get the best of both worlds here. 

The apartment- this was probably one of my favorite parts of the stay. The place was actually quite a bit larger than I had expected, and is flooded with peaceful natural lighting throughout. The building is older, yet clean and very well maintained; details such as the crown molding and textured ceiling create just the right amount of coziness and character to help you feel right at home. 

Overall, Their place is just wonderful, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",100

The apartment has an excellent feel that is both cozy and clean and it looks better than the pictures.  The host that arranges the Airbnb listing is very considerate and response to our needs quickly.  I also like the fact that the shared space is very tidy, with the host and the roommate very politely hiding away their personal stuff.  Be aware of the noise in the morning, as sometimes there can be mechanical noises (lawnmower?) as early as 6:30 am .

When I was initially booking her place, I was a little unsure as it was her first time hosting and she hadn't received any reviews yet. However, I can now say that it was a great decision and I'm very happy with the choice! Its affordable, comfortable and clean.  You can tell that Shannon really enjoys decorating her home-- it is full of gorgeous pieces of art and collectible items from Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones etc. It has all the amenities one might need. Shannon was also extremely approachable throughout-- she responded to our msgs instantly and was very helpful. To top it all, she left us a box of chocolates as a welcome gift!

While we were there, we were also looking after her pets-- two rabbits and some fish. However, the chores involved were easy, taking only 20 mins of our time everyday. One drawback was that the rabbits tended to poop in corners of the room which would then need brooming. But, it was completely worth it, since her rabbits are absolutely adorable and fun to live with. Though shy in the beginning, they warmed up to us over time, and Hope would even nudge us for cuddles! Shannon also had an automatic feeder set up, as well as a Rumba Vacuum Cleaner which would clean most of their poop.

I would recommend her place to anyone! Its cozy, quirky and beautiful in decoration, and comes with adorable pets.",100

Great bang for the buck, reflecting the neighborhood to a certain degree, and felt safe inside the unit. Note that bedroom C is street facing, so if you don't manage street noise well then bedroom B (notably smaller) may be a better option. Thanks again Jean!!!",80

She was willing to invite me to things she was doing if I had no other plans. I felt more like a 'friend' than simply a guest in someone else's home. I'd absolutely recommend staying here if that's the type of experience you're looking for.",100

Communication was easy and prompt, we even had a FaceTime conversation before our arrival so that we could iron out the details of our stay before we arrived. As far as affordability in the city during New Years Eve, you really cannot beat the value! 
 
Upon arrival we had difficulty finding a parking space. (It is NYC so of course it is understandable that having a vehicle can be tricky!) Danielle was more than happy to answer a phone call from us late in the evening to explain the parking signs. Once she helped us decipher the signs we easily found a spot in front of the apartment! Do not be intimidated by the street signs, just be sure to read them and you will be fine!  

The apartment was adorable and had everything you would need and more. It was decorated very tastefully and felt like a funky, authentic, New York experience! We were very comfortable and happy in our home away from home, especially after long days walking in the frigid temperatures! 

Transportation could not have been easier! The subway is a short walk down Astoria Blvd. We took the opportunity to grab bagels and coffee every morning before venturing out. Astoria was charming and felt completely safe even in the early hours of the morning when we would arrive home. There were many late night options for food within the few blocks to the subway. The train was almost fool proof to get into Manhattan. 

Above all, Danielle truly made the effort to be available to us at any time even though she was on vacation herself!  We met some of her friends to receive and return the keys, clearly she is a very well loved person who is integrated into her neighborhood community. Her kindness and generosity made our stay all the more enjoyable.",100

""I didn't meet Emily, I had contact by mail and phone and she arranged everything for my coming (key, etc.). There was one room mate. The room is as in the photo and clean.

21398486,215276441,2017-11-28,23314091,"Zoe","We stayed for a little over two weeks while we transitioned between apartments. The location is great - about 7 minutes to the R/Union and 10 to the Q/7th Avenue (there are more subways, those are the two we used to commute to work).  20-25 min walk to BAM/Barclays/Target. There's a grocery store (Union Market) on the corner at 6th Ave (try the blue duck pies), a new coffee shop across the street and a Chinese restaurant next door with great vegetarian options.  6th ave is pretty residential so it's quiet.  I used the laundromat 1/2 a block up Union (towards 7th) that's right next to a really cool cafe/bar/music spot called Sir D's lounge.  Union Hall is also a great bar to check out on Union (towards 5th).  The host, Elise has been in Park Slope forever and knows everyone so she is definitely a wealth of information about the area (she runs the community center downstairs). 

Elise and her chill dog lived upstairs about 2/3 of our stay.  She is absolutely lovely. We didn't mind her sharing the stairwell (she walks by the kitchen and living room on the way up and down - there's a curtain that you can close for privacy).  The bedroom and bathroom are through a door that can stay closed for privacy so you can walk between the bedroom and bathroom and not be seen from hallway that host will access.

The open kitchen and dining and living area is really functional - there's a desk, dining table and counter-top seating and an L shaped couch.  We hosted Thanksgiving (3 of us) and it was a very comfortable space for the meal (probably could have had up to 5 people over for dinner).  There's also a back deck that we didn't use much because of cold weather but would be great for warmer conditions.  Also a fire place you can use.

Bedroom has a huge bed and is really comfortable with warm blankets.  Lots of storage in drawers, shelves and closet for clothing for longer stays.   Bathroom has good storage too.

We adored all of the arts and craft decorations - wall murals, handthrown dishes, wall storage for coats upon entry, etc.

I definitely recommend staying here.",100

I believe that our host Marc is new to Airbnb. We have given him advice regarding expectations of cleanliness and the provision of basic kitchen utensils, pots, cutlery etc. If these issues are addressed, I would recommend the apartment. If not, I would not be inclined to stay there again.",60

They were very accommodating especially when I told them of our change in plans and asked to modify the reservation. The apartment was spacious for our group and we all appreciated having enough space to hangout all together, whether at the table in the kitchen or downstairs in the living room. It felt very homely and sweet. The location was great for us in particular because we were only a 10 min drive from some dance events we went to. 

Only thing that could be improved on is cleanliness. Some tabletops and nightstands were not wiped down, as there were water marks and other clear markings of use. Both shower curtains were moldy and there was a lot of dust under the bunk beds. The fridge had leftover food from previous guests and some half or almost empty jugs of expired milk. The freezer didn't have anything in it but was smelly.

Other than that thank you Gui and Isabella for your kindness and for the stay! All the best to you both",80

I would recommend booking the apartment based on the location alone but you get so much more with it. Jessica was prompt in responding to any queries we had and resolving any issues that came up. I stayed in the apartment with two other family members and the space was ideal for the three of us. It is a spacious apartment according to NYC standards but I would not recommend staying here with more than three people as it might get tight.

I enjoyed roaming the streets and ducking into the local businesses, in addition to my events in other parts of Manhattan. 

The best part was definitely the location. Second best was that everything worked! There are three things I look for in a room: A comfortable shower, wifi, and cleanliness. Jenny's place was strong in all of these traits. 

Sharing her coffee and produce was a nice touch. I was also in need of an iron and closet space as I was attending a wedding. Jenny readily accommodated. 

Jenny's restaurant recommendations were good, too. She steered me away from the tourist-y stuff to a fantastic soul food restaurant called Sylvia's. I ate there twice in the same day!

I had a few questions after check-in and Jenny was very responsive. She was even willing to come back to help me with a question, but it turned out to be a non-issue. 

I highly recommend Jenny's apartment.",100

We were a party of three staying for just under a week and wanted to be in a place that was central to the main pitstops of the city. The location of the apartment was perfect, and very accessible for uber and taxi's that we were travelling in (if it wasn't so cold we would have been walking a lot more!). 
Chelsea was extremely hospitable and had left lots of personal touches for us to make us feel welcome while she was away on holiday herself. She had also left us the details of her friend who lived close by in case we needed any extra help.  
The apartment was very comfortable and there was plenty of bedding for us, so we were very happy while spending time inside. The kitchen was small but still great for what we needed, and we often were able to make teas, coffees and buy groceries and make some of our meals. The bathroom is tiny so be warned! Although with a shower cap we were able to manoeuvre around, and considering we were three women all with long hair, we did pretty well and didn't find it uncomfortable. 
Chelsea was always fast to communicate with us and answer any questions we had. We would definitely recommend her as a super duper host and would love to stay here again.

The walls are very thin so can hear lots of stomping from apartment up above and a guitar player next door that sounded like a drowning cat. Also, the heating in the room is VERY noisy. Having said that it's nothing that a set of good earplugs won't fix.

The kitchen is great but if you want to cook your own food it's a challenge as there is minimal cooking equipment. 

The bed is super comfy and Sijh bought all new bedding which was nice. 

So, if you want a good location within walking distance to lots of places than this Airbnb is for you.",60

The view from the living room/kitchen, day and night is spectacular!  (of note; the bedrooms have blinds, but there is so much light, you might want to bring eye shades if you are dealing with jet lag).  

Karen had brand new towels for me (literally: some had the tags still on---so--brand new); all three room heaters/air con units worked well so that even though it was freezing in New York when I visited, it was warm inside (72 degrees) and each room could be independently adjusted.  

The frig, washer, dryer, stove, and range all worked and I used all of them (Karen even had OJ and soda water for me).  

The apartment has a doorman (secure) and parking is one block away in a hotel (can't remember how much a day).

A few notable points:
1) The bedrooms are quiet.  This is not to be underestimated in New York.  I did not hear other rooms or units or occupants--no doors, voices, stereos.  The building must be a warehouse conversion with solid concrete floors and walls---seriously; never heard anyone from inside the bedrooms.
2) The views are ---spectacular 
3) Uber and Lyft found the unit easily every time, usually within 2 to 6 minutes each time
4) Karen was accessible very shortly within every time I had a question

Thank you, Karen! May you have more success and enjoyment sharing your place with other AirBnBers!",100

It is a true apartment style house away from home.  Also no need to bring houseware.  Everything is provided.  Alex and co were very generous and communicated in timely manner (thanks Jacob, Karisa and Erik), house mates were amazing! I felt welcomed and had all questions answered if needed.  I honestly would not bother trying anywhere else, just because the bar and standard has been set.  This is how to run a business!

There is also an express train that stops at another subway which is just a bit further away.  Both subway stops are super close!  There are probably more, but we primarily used two with the exception of the time we walked to Barclay Center station because we had to do a bit of shopping.

The parking wasn't difficult.  I found a spot immediately when we arrived.  During our visit I had to call AAA because my vehicle would not start due to the cold temperatures (my vehicle sat without running for a few days).  I drove it around the block a few times and found an even closer parking spot after helping the battery recharge.

Check-in was super quick and easy.

The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was warm.  We felt safe there.  We walked around after dark without a worry in the world.  The neighborhood is safe.

We ate pizza from delivery places around the apartment.  We also walked to an Italian place called Cataldos (amazing!).

Matt & Kat are incredibly accommodating and responsive hosts, and their home is very cozy. We especially loved watching movies together as a family on their huge flat screen.

We could have used a little more instruction on where to find things like linens & toilet paper but what we couldn't find was promptly delivered thanks to Amazon ;)!",80

Chris made it easy to check in and out of the Airbnb, although he was not around during the duration of our stay.  He was easy to communicate with and would respond to any questions within 48 hours.  The individual room was clean with fresh sheets, however the common areas such as the kitchen, dining room and bathroom were on the dirty side with food being left out from other guests and dishes in the sink.  The bathroom did not have towels, shampoo, conditioner or body wash for guests to use so guests were expected to bring their own.  There was a hairdryer for guests to use.  The beds did not have the most comfortable mattress and were on the thinner, harder side.  What I loved most about this place was the location! It was extremely convenient walking to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, plenty of restaurants and bars and much more! Overall, the place was a great price compared to other hotels for what was provided and the location.",60

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Ola personally but she is very communicative and helpful and we had no trouble at all contacting her.
She trusted us her home and her cat which took some time to get used to but worked out ok.

You can get midtown or downtown on the 3 train in a giffy if you need too. Was also cheap by NY standards (which is still expensive, of course). But there was no heat in December and I froze my @$$ off.  To clarify, I'm not saying it wasn't heated to my liking, I'm saying there was zero heat. In December. I contacted Adrianne and the superintendent repeatedly but nothing changed while I was here. I know this is not Adrianne's fault, I'm sure it's a case of an old building and a negligent landlord, but point is when you pay what you pay for a airbnb in NY you shouldn't be sleeping while shovering in a tracksuit and a toque, or unable to work on your labtop cause your hands are so cold.  Secondly, the person Adrianne hired to clean the place between my arrival and the previous guests departure did a really half-ass job. Didn't even touch the bathroom, I know cause the trashbin was full and the bathtub had visible grime and hair. Germaphobe's nightmare. Again, I know this wasn't Adrianne's fault, just being honest about my experience.  Other things to keep in mind is that there is no closet space or coathangers and the oven has been converted to storage (there is a toaster however). If Adrianne could ensure her unit was heated in the winter and hire a cleaner who actually cleaned it would be a great spot.",40

The host was available on the phone, so that was great. The apartment is as it seems in the pictures, just a little bit more worn out and the bathroom is really tiny. Overall, we were happy with our stay there, we just felt there were two issues. The first one, of minor importance, was the heating that did this awful hissing sound all night and day and we could not turn off, so the apartment was very, very hot and we couldn't sleep without the windows open. The other one, though, was disturbing to us, since the owner of the apartment wanted us to assure him that we are prepared to lie to an inspector, he or she may come, that we are renting the apartment for 2 months. He even had a fake lease agreement prepared in case we needed it. Apparently, if we would not lie, we would be thrown out of the apartment and left on the street. Nothing actually happened, but honestly, lying to representatives of the state is not on my list of things I want to do when coming to the USA from Europe, so that was really not up to my taste.",60

Just had some issues. One is that the thermostat max capability was around 60 F when we were here, so if you are not used to that temperature, you would find the house a bit cold. Another is the room might be a bit small for two if you both are overweight. Aside from that, as John said, the housemates just kept to themselves and rarely talked to us. But I am not really sure whether they liked us staying or not. One wrote a bit hostile reminders with capital letters on the white board. Another vomited all over the toilet and left it like that for the whole day. However, it was New Year Eve so we tried to put it into context.

In all, the room was inexpensive and acceptable to us. Things happened just like anywhere and we wouldn't mind living in the place if we visit again!",100

During my stay, he constantly checks how my stay is, and chats as a friend which I enjoy a lot. Regarding the place, it is amazingly the same as how it shows in the picture! Stylish and clean! -- Best of all, we have a huge common area and TV & Netflix to enjoy with other guests -- they are all very friendly. I like the location too, which is 5-min walk to the station and 30-min subway to midtown. There is a supermarket and CVS pharmacy next to the subway station -- it's very convenient! Initially I was a bit concerned that it was in Harlem whose reputation is not great, while the area is actually safe -- I feel quite OK even when I returned home at night.

The house is ideally located, a couple of street corners from the L line which took us to Manhattan in less than 15 minutes. The house is comfortable and the kitchen very well equipped.

First, the good stuff: the location is really excellent; we were able to walk a very short distance to all the subway stations, (very important when trying to avoid the cold), and it's close to Chelsea Market. The apartment was larger than I expected for Manhattan, maximizing main living/bedroom space, but with a tiny bathroom. We didn't use the secondary room at all because it was too cold (there is a cold draft from the skylight), nor the balcony that it leads to (obviously). The WIFI was very fast!

The apartment seems a bit old, heated only by two radiators, which get plenty hot. One morning, we woke up without hot water or heat. A quick text message to Jeanmarc, and he got it fixed by the time we came back. The kitchen is small, but has everything you need.

The bad: We had a harrowing experience trying to get in the apartment itself. Since Jeanmarc was in Florida, we spent a long time struggling with the lockbox, which we never did open, outside in the dark with our freezing fingers. Fortunately, we were able to get a backup key. There was also an Italian restaurant below the apartment which we could go inside for warmth (the pasta al Funghi is excellent). To his credit, Jeanmarc was always available by text and phone, and he made sure we got in that first night. But I would prefer check-in in person for my next trip.

Overall, we had a pretty good stay. We saved a lot of money versus a hotel, but we also sacrificed the hospitality, so it's just about right.",80

The apartment is modern, perfectly clean and on a quiet block.  Geoff met me at the apartment with the keys and answered all my questions.  He even left a few snacks for me.  The bed was really comfortable - really soft sheets and a great memory foam mattress.  The kitchen, living room and bathroom were spotless and there's also a private rooftop with an incredible view! The area is quiet and safe, and it is just a few minutes walk to the subway, which is only 2 stops from Manhattan. In one direction you can walk to South Park Slope, where there are some cute restaurants, bars and shops.  In the other direction you can head into Sunset Park where there is a lovely park and lots of authentic Mexican restaurants.

The amazing view of the East River and Manhattan Bridge every day was just mesmerizing and inspiring to enjoy our days in NYC for New Year's Eve 2018. It's definitely in a prime location as well in the center of Dumbo with many eateries and shops nearby close to the Brooklyn Bridge Park. The apartment is definitely worth the trip across the bridge just for the view and away from the buzzing Manhattan noise.

It was also soooo close to the A/C train, like three blocks. There's a local market a block away. And there's a Walgreens three and a half blocks away, and Lors of fast food options as well as local restaurant options within one to three blocks, from a Dominican restaurant, to a bakery with some vegan options, to chains for chicken and a Burger King.

His room was a mess - dirty linens, unmade bed, dirty rug/floor, stained sofa (that he told me someone could comfortably sleep on), dirty bathroom, dirty kitchen, and no toilet paper. My brother and I were extremely uncomfortable at Sina's but had no choice but to stay as it was a busy time in NYC. We could not believe how dirty his apartment was. DO NOT HOST IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMMODATE FOR YOUR GUESTS. We actually had to go out and buy new sheets, towels, bathroom cleaner, and toilet paper it was that disgusting. I absolutely do not recommend anyone staying at Sina's. For the amount that we had to pay for our stay, we are outraged that we did not get a refund. 

Tips for Airbnb guests - always ask your host for all possible stay accommodations before you purchase. We had no idea that we would not be accommodated for basic hygiene necessities like toilet paper and clean bed linens. 

This entire experience makes me rethink Airbnb as a choice for vacation stay. Airbnb guests, please be forewarned about this listing.",40

22195204,224851066,2018-01-04,23265998,"Jeff","This place is a steal. To get the obvious out of the way: Yes, the room is technically a ""loft"" and if you are over 5 feet 6 inches (or thereabouts) tall, you cannot stand up without bumping your head, and yes, there is not a proper door.  BUT.  For my purposes this didn't matter, as I didn't plan on spending hours and hours in my bedroom -- I mainly wanted a comfortable place to sleep at night, for low cost, and with easy access to the subway. This place fit the bill, and then some. There's far more privacy than you would guess from the listing, as the other roommates did a great job of creating a makeshift wall that shields you from the living room. I stayed for 7 nights, and at no point did I feel a lack of privacy. Bonus? The building itself is AWESOME. A solid gym, a pool, a sauna, and a large game room, of sorts, where you can chill. Two blocks to the L-train. Other bonus? The roommates are awesome. Next time I visit New York, I hope to stay here again. Recommended.",100

The room, the bathroom and the small kitchen were clean.

The heater made a disconcerting noise at night but I know this is common to old NY apartments. Our stay (4 people, 3 adults and teenager) lasted 5 nights and the problem we had were this:

1- Communication with host Marcela was very difficult. She did not know the Airbnb platform forcing me to exchange messages via text messages, phones which generated a lot of stress before and during our stay.

2- She mixed Tripadvisor links with AIrbnb always causing confusion to our negotiation.

3- After paying the reservation and as she did not accept to return the money of the reservation she imposed a contract next to me the day of our trip charging me 400 dollars against damages to be paid outside the platform Airbnb (via (Hidden by Airbnb) ) that would be returned in 14 days (I hope I get that money back).

4- We felt compelled to pay because we could not go back with the reservation.

5- The two single beds 1 was for child and the other one was too small for an adult. In addition the mattresses were uncomfortable was very uncomfortable. Sleeping on beds like this for 5 nights was not easy at all.

6- Every time we tried to contact them to sort out such small details as the beds she told us that we should settle for what we had and for the price we paid.

7- The successive requirements that were added until the day of our trip was very unpleasant.

In summary the apartment is very good but the EXPERIENCE was very negative and frustrating due to constant communication problems with our host.",40

Taking extremely long to reply or not responding for days at a time. He is not very friendly and if you have issues, do not count on them being fixed quickly. If you do not mind things not working properly like the bed being broken or the drain in the shower not draining, stay here. The doormen in the lobby are very nice and were probably the highlight of the place. Dog friendly location so you will see plenty of pets. The view is gorgeous in the daytime and at night. The furniture needs to be updated, but for a few days stay, it is cozy. I hope travelers have a better stay than we did.",40

The room in which we stayed had a private bathroom which ideally I feel is like a luxury in New York. There was an abundance of natural light in the room during daytime. The host (Camila) was away on vacation when we visited her place, so there was some delayed communication with Camila at times. The overall neighbourhood was calm and safe. This place was at a distance of 40 minutes from JFK airport. Overall it was good experience staying at the location.",80

The high ceiling and sparkling clean modern furnishings and appliances gave the condo a very classy feel. Everything regarding this Airbnb was simple -- from contacting Lawrence, to getting the keys, to having two beds ready for two people, to using the condo's amenities (like the pool table), to adjusting the temperature to our room, to checking out. Lawrence was super welcoming! He was fun to chat with, and he really went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our time there.

Also, the house has a great living room with very big TV and comfortable couches. From the house, it's just a 30 min to the Forest Ave station (M TRAIN).  A big supermarket around the corner.

The location was great, close to Prince, Spring and Houston Sts. It is just a few blocks from the subway.  It was also surrounded with restaurants and cute little boutiques of all kinds. 

The apartment itself is cozy; it is not large. But, it has everything you need for a very nice stay.  The kitchen is very well equipped with a nice stove, refridgerator, microwave, and a dishwasher! We had all the dishes we needed. 

The living room is comfortable and includes two adjoining sofas around a little table. This is where one eats. It is practical and convenient. There are two TVs in the apartment, one in the living room, the other in the bedroom. 

The bathroom has a nice bathtub and seems newly done. 
The bedroom is very nice, The queen bed is very comfortable. The bed linens are lovely.  The bedroom is very quiet, as is the whole apartment is located in the back of the building. It is very nice to come home after a busy day and sit in a quiet space away from the hubbub of NYC.

getaway weekend in NYC!

Pleasant host and was very communicative and accommodating with check in/check out bc of my early travel time.

And literally around the corner from the subway.  

The space is clean, warm, comfortable and well appointed with modern streamable smart TVs, dinnerware, utensils and even coffee, tea, and bottled water. The stairs to access the suite is a bit much as it's two flights down but it's well lit and the furniture and brand new bedroom set/mattresses were very comfortable.

I had to stand out in the cold for a while to try to contact Airbnb. I happened to run in to Dom on the street while on the phone with  a rep. He was surprised that I was there and that I recognized him. He showed me to room, and at first glance .. the place was very dirty. There werw pile of trash and diry dishes everywhere. He showed me to the room and tol me he was going to have some friends come from out of state for NYE. The friends showed up and they started smoking marijuana and and have drinks. Im military,I was very clear to him before and during checking in, that I could not be around marijuana. But he still smoked and was having a great time. I told him I had to leave, and that I would call to cancel. He was very nice and just let me out, and was reseanoble about my request. After I left, all his friends started laughing as if to make fun of me for not being able to be around such a lifestyle. I booked a hotel, Airbnb refunded me after they tried to contact Dom with no aswer. Airbnb also gave me a voucher to help pay for my hotel.

The attention to detail was phenomenal. The room was also equipped with 2 chargers: 1 iphone and 1 samsung. In the corner she had a water and 2 glasses for us. 
She even printed out maps highlighting the places she recommends near the apt and in manhattan. 

Omur made the entire place available for us and even invited us to make ourselves at home with her coffee, snacks, and fridge. My girlfriend was also very excited to have a salon quality hair dryer she could use for the cold winter days. 
The apartment is located in a very nice area with easy access to the subway. Plenty of restaurants walking distance. 
If I come back to NYC, i will certainly look to stay with Omur again. THANK YOU SO MUCH and greetings from Hollywood!",100

And Amanda is so friendly, she would love to share local info. It was helpful to travel. I like her dog Walter. So adorable!! You can see him talking haha.

SPACE: Asha has impeccable taste. Though she recently moved into this apartment, the space is wonderfully decorated. It is obvious to the undiscerning eye that she put a lot of thought and love into the endeavor. We felt at home and the room in which we stayed in was cozy and inviting. Though the building is historical, there was a perfect balance of old-school charm and modernity. 

LOCATION: You will not be disappointed. The neighborhood is safe and approximately a five-minute walk from the Utica subway station. My friend and I were able to get to many areas of the city fairly quickly and appreciated the convenience. 

COMMUNICATION: Asha is incredibly responsive. She responded to our reservation in a matter of minutes and addressed all of our questions. She communicated her house rules, none of which were unreasonable, and was understanding and flexible when we had to push back our check-in time. We were also impressed with her thorough check-in. She walked us through the space, informed us of every thing we could possibly need to know about it, provided us with local recommendations for dining and shopping, and encouraged us to reach out to her if we needed additional assistance or to relay feedback that could help improve our stay.

HOST: Asha is one of the most warm, friendly, and charming hosts we have met. We could not be more thankful for her hospitality and generosity. Asha ensured we felt comfortable and at home. Her expectations of us were reasonable and straightforward. We appreciated that she wanted us to feel at home and struck the perfect balance between being involved and allowing us the space to be independent. 

BOTTOM LINE: Book this space! You will not regret the value, convenience, or experience!",100

22545136,237089886,2018-02-21,53023807,"Victor","Stayed here as part of family of 4.  It is a basic studio apartment, probably better suited for 2 people but still comfortable enough for 4.

Here is what we liked:
- apartment was very clean
- excellent location - many shops and huge variety of restaurants on 37th street or Northern Boulevard are a short walk away.   Also the 7 train, which we took to/from Manhattan, has a stop on 90th street which is very close to the apartment.  
- main bed was very comfortable.  Note that second bed is an air mattress, my kids slept on it, this was included in the original listing so we were fine with this.
- Host was very responsive and helpful - host had forgotten to provide a hairdryer and made the effort to deliver the following day.

Here are some things to keep in mind:
- We stayed in the apartment in February.  The apartment is in an older building and in the winter the upper floors get very hot as the heat can not be finely controlled.  We had to sleep with some of the windows open.   From experience, I believe this is out of the hosts' control, it is just the way these buildings operate.  I did not check with the host to determine if there was a way to turn off or turn down the heat.
- the apartment was missing some basic items.  These are easily correctable for future guests and I have communicated details to the host.  As mentioned above, the host is very responsive and wants her guests to have a comfortable stay.

Overall I would recommend this place and would stay here again in the future.",80

The neighborhood is distinct, making it a nice location by itself with a really strong Brooklyn vibe.

Her place was neatly clean and organized.  She even provided vegan-friendly breakfast to us, which we found to be a great plus. We will definitely stay at Jackee's place again on our next visit to NYC. Thank you and many blessings to you, Jackee!",100

The room has it's own private entrance and guests have their own full bathroom that is very clean! Carissa's room is located all the way on the other side of the apt, which allows for more privacy and minimal noise. The apartment is located near the M and J lines ( quick 5min walk to the station).

The room was in the basement next to the working studio which was also listed in the description but it wasn't listed that there was no real window, so you didn't get any fresh air or sunlight down there. The room itself was nice and the bedsheets were clean. But the bathroom really wasn't, it felt quite unsanitary.. The location of the accommodation on the other hand is good and within a couple of minutes you reach bus and subway. So, since the airbnb is quite cheap for New York you can't expect luxury, but you could expect cleaner facilities.",80

This is NOT the experience we have had with other airbnbs. Our hosts were so attentive to our needs without being intrusive. The apartment was PRISTINE!  We were steps away from the subways.

The staff was really nice and did what they could to make it up to me for having to change rooms.

The one thing I will note is that the hotel tax is collected by the hotel at checkout, and can be significant.  This was a surprise to me because in other cities, AirBNB collects hotel taxes directly, so I thought the tax was included in what I paid AirBNB.

It's super close to the L subway line (less than 20 minutes to Manhattan) and there are lots of great places to eat in the area (try Roberta's pizza!).

It also always felt safe walking around even late at night. The apartment is spacious, light & warm & has all the basic kitchen necessities you need (aka kettle & coffee maker).

I had a 7AM bus out of NYC and I could literally wake up at 6:30AM and walk the 10 minutes over the Port Authority and still be at the front of the line.
Vale is a very experience Airbnb host. She's also super friendly and accommodating. I really enjoyed getting to meet up with her and talk about her lifestyle as a New Yorker over coffee (honestly this alone was worth the trip).
The apartment itself was very much adequate. There was a nice little kitchen with all of the necessities (cups, hot water maker, stove, fridge, etc) and a nice bathroom. The room was clean and functional. It's certainly not like a hotel with a big-screen TV and marble flooring, but for someone looking for a central location to get the most out of their stay in NYC, this is the place.",100

Since they have a family too, they understood our needs given that we have a little one too. The space was very high end and clean. It is perfect for a family and worth every dime compared to hotels in New York. Though Brooklyn is busy, it's on a quiet side street but not too far from the express subway line and grocery store. It was the perfect home away from home. We loved it.",100
22971238,239643013,2018-03-02,119838474,"Brice","I've used Airbnb several times before, and this was by far my worst experience.   The neighborhood seems unsafe and gross with trash everywhere.   There is no parking anywhere. Parking isn't allowed on the street, the host doesn't allow parking in her driveway, and the nearby parking garages either don't allow overnight parking or have a non- working phone number. The host didn't know where to park, and didn't even know the color of ""her"" own house.  Before I even checked in, she kept asking what time I was checking out.   I'm suspicious that this isn't her home, but maybe a friend or relatives home she's using without permission.  Why else would she be so paranoid about what time I leave in the morning.  Airbnb needs to investigate this because she might be running a fraudulent business at a parent's or relative's home.",20

There's also a washer/dryer in the unit, which is quite rare to come across. 

As a host, Thomas was very friendly and made the check-in/check-out process easy and convenient. He was quick to respond and even checked in (over text) during my stay to ensure that everything was going well.

Their unit is in a completely renovated and contemporary-style condo building on the second floor; there was virtually no street noise.  Security in the building is very good. The location is superb, being two blocks from the Montrose Ave ""L"" subway line station (just 20 minutes to Union Square).  There are lots of good places to eat around there too.  The parking was surprisingly easy to find right on the same street (by contrast, this is a constant issue in NYC).  The bedroom we used was cozy; my daughter used the comfortable loft bed, while the foam mat I used was also quite comfortable.  You may use their kitchen facilities (which we did not actually need). One note: they do have a room mate in his own room; but he kept to himself and we never saw him; there is a lock on the door of the bedroom you will use if that makes you feel better.

Communication with him prior to arrival was very nice and when I was being late for two hours due to some construction he was very cooperative and met me at his place at a later time. He also gave me recommendations about what I could do there during my time in NYC. The easiest way to get to the apartment from JFK airport is to take LIRR from Jamaica to Nostrand Ave which takes about 15 minutes. From there you can either take a uber or walk 15 minutes to the apartment. My eight night stay in the apartment was very nice and cozy. I had everything I need for my stay. The bed is comfortable and could easily fit two people. Bathroom is also nice. WiFi ist fast and stable. The apartment is great located with just two minutes to the Franklin Ave subway station. Subway line 2,3,4,5 brings you to Manhatten in 30 minutes. Very close to Prospect Park. Plenty of food options close to the apartment, as well as shops for daily things just around the corner. Due to my flight was starting in the evening I could even stay longer and checkout late without additional costs.

23254811,238369824,2018-02-25,142994077,"Tazmin","Sankey was a great communicator. Unfortunately, we did not meet him since he was traveling, but his roommates were very welcoming, and Sankey checked in with us via (Hidden by Airbnb) to be sure we arrived and everything was okay. We could tell the apartment was cleaned often, but there were a couple cockroaches in the bathroom. Probably just a fact of life in an older Brooklyn apartment building. The whole apartment smelled strongly of weed, which may not bother everyone, but gave me a bit of a headache. The price of the room was great, but we were surprised to discover it wasn't a full room but a part of the living room that had been walled off. That wouldn't be a problem except that the new walls didn't reach all the way to the ceiling, so it was easy to hear everything happening in the apartment. The first night was fine, I was so tired. But the second night I was woken up around 7:30AM by the pet birds in the kitchen, and again later by a roommate making breakfast. The bed was also pretty uncomfortable, and the mattress easily moved and seemed slanted to one side. Again, we probably wouldn't have been able to come to New York without such an affordable Airbnb, so if you need a safe and well-located place to stay, this neighborhood was pretty quiet and very close to the subway.",60

First and foremost, they were wonderful and very attendant hosts. They were gracious and considerate and kept in touch throughout my stay to make sure that my experience at their home was both comfortable and enjoyable. They were accessible and communicative and it was wonderful getting to talk to them about their home and their lives here in New York.

Secondly, their home is truly a beautiful and well-preserved piece of Brooklyn history. While it's architectural detail and design is grand, romantic, and sophisticated, its place and influence in the political and cultural landscape of Brooklyn is unique and remarkable in its own right. (Be sure to have Elizabeth and Bruce tell you more about the history of this building!)

Lastly, the fact that their home is just a stone's throw from the best that New York has to offer is an absolute perk that should not be taken for granted. Within a short walk you have the beauty and vibrancy of Prospect Park, the culture and diversity of Church Ave, the thriving nightlife and local bars and restaurants along Cortelyou Rd, and the stunning (and enviable) historical stately homes of Ditmas Park. Though if you really want to stay close to home, there's also a cozy bodega next door as well noteworthy bars and restaurants within a block or two. And for those dying to get into Manhattan, their home is just down the street from the BQ line, making a trip into the city a breeze.

To sum my review up, this place is a labor of love for Elizabeth and Bruce and if you're looking for a true and authentic New York experience while avoiding crowds, tourists, and scenesters you will not be disappointed with your stay here.

Thank you Elizabeth and Bruce!",100

They were flexible with the check in time. They provided towels for you, TV for you to watch, or listen to music, and had heating/AC. Also, had WiFi.

The floor was a bit dirty, since its tiles dust and debris seem to accumulate quickly, so I would recommend bringing a pair of shoes/socks to walk around in (I like being barefoot).  There was no window in the room, which I didn't realize while booking so that was a bit of a bummer, but that's just my own preference. Lastly, the place is a bit far from the city, so be prepared to drive a ton if you're looking to get to the main city. Everything else was great though!",80

The building is beautiful -- a classic Brooklyn brownstone only two blocks from the famous Prospect Park. There was a real classic New York family neighborhood feel to the area. It was very charming, and not hectic/unsafe. That said, the flat is literally one block from the subway that takes you straight into the craziness of Manhattan in about 15 minutes. So you really do get the best of both worlds. The room was immaculately clean and very tastefully decorated. Perfect for a solo traveler like me, or perhaps a couple. As for Molly, she is one of the kindest and most hospitable ladies you will ever meet. She keeps the place clean almost to a fault. She's very well traveled, is a joy to talk to, and she made me feel very welcome in her home. She's just a good, honest person and it becomes apparent immediately. I'd stay here again without hesitation. Thanks Molly, and sorry I couldn't be more useful at pub trivia!
